  Foreword (March 2023)
Almost 20 years ago, the OCEG Community created GRC and Principled Performance®. These ideas were formalized into a structured model we call the GRC Capability Model (“Model”). This model is periodically updated with the help of hundreds of members and experts in the GRC ecosystem. For this update, the objectives were to:
* Simplify - Make The GRC Capability Model easier to understand, navigate and use.
* Clarify - Untangle and elaborate key concepts and definitions.
* Augment - Include new concepts, models, and practices that are commonly used.
We achieved these objectives by adding, editing, and removing content throughout The GRC Capability Model and using new technologies to capture and publish this document.
 This document is organized into several sections:
* Introduction: Details about the drivers of Principled Performance and GRC.
* Using this Guide: Conventions used in the document and tips for starting.
* The GRC Capability Model
   * Part I - GRC Concepts: Pervasive ideas and models that underlie all aspects of GRC.
   * Part II - GRC Capabilities: Structured expression of high-performing GRC.
   * Part III - GRC Glossary: Alphabetic listing of consistent terms and definitions.
* Tools & Techniques: Collected tools & techniques referenced in this document.
You may read this document in any way and in any order. I find it helpful to:
* Read the Introduction to understand the big picture and context.
* Read the GRC Concepts because it outlines pervasive ideas used throughout.
* Read the GRC Glossary because it helps to untangle and harmonize vocabulary.
* Read the GRC Capabilities structured substance, element by element.
* Read the other sections.  
Warm Regards & Enjoy!

Introduction
Executive Summary
Over $1 trillion (USD) is destroyed every year because of unprincipled misconduct, mistakes, and miscalculations. Organizations, individuals, and the public count on GRC Professionals to lead the way and solve this trillion-dollar problem.  
GRC Professionals are called “Protectors” because of the work that they do. They produce and preserve value to achieve Principled Performance® – and to reliably achieve objectives, address uncertainty, and act with integrity.
Protectors are skilled GRC Professionals who advise and work in departments such as the board, strategy, risk, compliance, ethics, human resources, legal, security, quality, internal control, and audit. What they have in common is a Protector Mindset™ and an interdisciplinary Protector Skillset™.
But it can be difficult to be a Protector and address this massive trillion-dollar problem because of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA) – and the disconnection between departments (silos), people, values, and skills.
Therefore, the OCEG community created Principled Performance and GRC over 20 years ago – to help Protectors solve problems using an interdisciplinary approach. The continuously improving body of knowledge in this document codifies this approach in GRC Concepts, GRC Capabilities, and the GRC Glossary.  
The Problem: VUCA & Disconnection
More than ever before, organizations of all shapes and sizes operate in the context of volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) conditions. And, despite innovations designed to connect, organizations experience substantial disconnection:
   * Disconnected departments that operate in silos and at cross-purposes
   * Disconnected people with strained relationships that cause conflict and loneliness
   * Disconnected purpose and culture that cause misalignment with stakeholders
   * Disconnected and myopic skillsets that see and solve problems from a single discipline
VUCA and disconnection are substantial “destabilizing forces” that make it challenging to produce and preserve value. Protectors are the stabilizing forces to face this instability and to help organizations gain, maintain, and sustain Principled Performance.
The Solution: Principled Performance & GRC
The OCEG community created Principled Performance and GRC to overcome VUCA and disconnection – and to provide Protectors a framework for stabilizing and connecting in the face of so much instability and disconnection.
This connected and integrated approach is the essence of GRC – the pathway to Principled Performance. 
By adopting Principled Performance and GRC, an organization moves from disconnected departments to integrated capabilities; from disconnected people to interconnected relationships and coworkers; from disconnected purpose to intentional culture; and from disconnected and myopic skills to an interdisciplinary approach.   
The first peer-reviewed paper on the topic laid a foundation for this solution by providing clear definitions and guidance for Principled Performance and GRC.
Principled Performance
Principled Performance is a noble goal for every organization to “reliably achieve objectives, address uncertainty, and act with integrity.” The major parts of the definition are:
   * Reliably (thoughtfully, consistently, dependably, and transparently)
   * Achieve objectives (achieve mission, vision, and balanced objectives)
   * Address uncertainty (address opportunities and obstacles that balance risk and reward)
   * Act with integrity (live out values and stay within mandatory and voluntary boundaries)
Principled Performance is NOT synonymous with “Good” or “Good Intentions.” An organization must measure up to the Principled Performance definition to be a “principled performer.”  
To elaborate on the other side, just because an organization pursues objectives that someone might perceive as “Bad” or as “Bad Intentions” does not mean that the organization is NOT a Principled Performer. If this organization reliably achieves objectives, addresses uncertainty, and acts with integrity, then it qualifies as a Principled Performer.   

What matters is that the organization measures up to the key parts of the Principled Performance definition to:
   * reliably 
   * achieve objectives, 
   * address uncertainty, and 
   * act with integrity.
And to accomplish this, the organization must integrate and orchestrate several Critical Disciplines and capabilities.
“Big Picture” Perspective
Taking a step back, consider the big picture of what it means to “do” business. Every business, every organization, is designed to achieve objectives. As the organization drives toward objectives, it faces uncertainty – there are opportunities and obstacles along the way. And the organization must establish a business model to address obligations and stay within mandatory and voluntary boundaries.  
   * Opportunities are generally associated with reward (performance), a measure of the positive, favorable effect of uncertainty on objectives. Reward is addressed using performance management systems and key performance indicators (KPIs).
   * Obstacles are generally associated with risk, a measure of the negative, unfavorable effect of uncertainty on objectives. Risk is addressed using risk management systems and key risk indicators (KRIs).
   * Obligations are generally associated with compliance, a measure of the degree to which obligations and requirements are addressed. Compliance is addressed using compliance management systems and key compliance indicators (KCIs).

An organization must do more than manage the aspects of performance, risk, and compliance. An organization must also govern and provide assurance around performance (reward), risk, and compliance. Thus a complete picture of this approach is the governance, management, and assurance of performance, risk, and compliance.  
   * Management - directly guiding, controlling, and evaluating an entity by arranging and operating resources.
   * Governance - indirectly guiding, controlling, and evaluating an entity by constraining and conscribing resources.
   * Assurance - objectively and competently evaluating subject matter to provide justified conclusions and confidence that statements and beliefs about the subject matter are justified and true.
  

GRC & Critical Disciplines
GRC and the GRC Capability Model provide governance, management, and assurance of performance (reward), risk, and compliance.
GRC is an initialism that denotes Governance, Risk, and Compliance, but the reality is much more. GRC is the “integrated collection of capabilities that enable an organization to reliably achieve objectives, address uncertainty, and act with integrity.”
Thus, GRC is the “pathway” to Principled Performance representing a broad portfolio of departments and capabilities. GRC is sometimes misconstrued as “something the board does,” “a piece of software,” “a compliance program,” or even “IT security” or some other topical area.
In fact, GRC is an integration and orchestration of capabilities. It is an umbrella over several Critical Disciplines that share similarities but also have their distinct advantages.  
   * Governance & Oversight provides methods to guide, constrain and conscribe the organization to achieve its purpose, mission, vision, and values.
   * Strategy & Performance provides methods to guide, arrange and operate resources to achieve objectives and monitor performance.
   * Risk & Decision-Support provides methods to identify and address the effect of uncertainty on objectives, including ways to support decisions under uncertainty.
   * Compliance & Ethics provides methods to identify and address mandatory and voluntary obligations and the underlying ethical principles and values.
   * Security & Continuity provides methods to identify and address threats to critical physical and digital assets and infrastructure.
   * Audit & Assurance provides methods to enhance confidence that the organization is reliably achieving objectives, addressing uncertainty, and acting with integrity.
By integrating these disciplines, the unique strengths of each can be used to support the others. For example, the Compliance & Ethics discipline can add strength in dealing with policies and procedures to the other disciplines. The Strategy & Performance discipline can add strength in setting objectives, mapping strategies, etc.

  GRC Capabilities
The GRC Capability Model codifies the continuously improving body of knowledge about how GRC works in an organization. It comprises four (4) components and twenty (20) elements that help an organization ask and answer key questions such as:
   * LEARN - Who are we? Where are we? What might affect us? Who do we serve? How will they judge us? What is our business model?

   * ALIGN - Where are we going? How will we get there? How will we address the opportunities, obstacles, and obligations along the way?

   * PERFORM - How proactive are we? How do we detect problems and progress? How do we respond to favorable and unfavorable events?

   * REVIEW - Are we making progress? How confident are we? How can we improve?
High-performing GRC Professionals and Protectors use The GRC Capability Model in many different jobs, roles, and departments and in organizations of all types, shapes, and sizes. The GRC Capability Model provides a sound foundation and versatile toolkit for diverse problems in diverse departments.
________________
  Protectors
Organizations, coworkers, and the public count on GRC Professionals to solve the $1 trillion problem. GRC Professionals are called Protectors because of the work that they do in departments across the organization. A high-performing Protector is a versatile professional who takes an interdisciplinary approach to their job.   
Whether they're implementing a compliance program, a risk management program, a security program, or conducting an audit, using a GRC approach means they are leveraging the best strengths and techniques from all of the Critical Disciplines.
Produce & Preserve Value
One misconception is that a Protector only "plays defense" while the rest of the organization "plays offense" – and that "playing defense" and "playing offense" are mutually exclusive. 
The truth is that every organization must play both offense and defense because both add significant value. High-performing Protectors know how to DO both and BE both.   
Protectors are typically not in functions that harness the forces of VUCA and instability (such as sales, marketing, and product innovation). More typically, Protectors are in departments such as the board, risk, compliance, security, finance, security, HR, IT, internal controls, or audit.  


Wherever they work, the organization and the public count on Protectors to be skilled at balancing value production and value preservation – to be the ones who serve as stabilizing forces and help the entire organization navigate VUCA and instability.
Using an analogy of a mountain climber – as climbers progress toward a summit, they "produce value" toward that goal. Along the way, there are ups and downs. Things can go wrong, and progress can be stopped or reversed. Things can go very wrong, and the climber may fall into deep crevasses, permanently destroying value.  


But high-performing Protectors lock in the progress and close gaps with tools and techniques to "preserve value" along the way. 
Preserving value not only reduces the “downs,” but it also helps to prevent fatal problems that permanently destroy value. This helps organizations to reliably achieve objectives, address uncertainty, and act with integrity – and achieve Principled Performance.  


In the context of mountain climbing, this might include tools such as ropes and clamps. It might mean techniques like tapping into the side of the mountain to secure safety gear. 
In organizations, these tools include how Protectors use the Protector Mindset™ and Protector Skillset™ to implement GRC and achieve Principled Performance. These tools are the unmistakable “fingerprint” of a high-performing Protector:
      * The Protector Mindset™ is the toolkit of ways that a high-performing Protector makes decisions and appraises problems, solutions, and people. It is the way that they “think” about their job.
      * The Protector Skillset™ is the toolkit of versatile disciplines that a high-performing Protector uses to solve problems, make progress, and lead. It is the way that they “do” their job.
________________
The Protector Mindset™
The Protector Mindset™ consists of traits that together strengthen the way that a high-performing Protector makes decisions and appraises problems, solutions, people, and reality.
The high-performing Protector is Collaborative, Accountable, Stable, Proactive, Visionary, and Versatile. Importantly, a Protector strives for the Golden Mean between the overuse and underuse of these traits.  


Collaborative
Producing and preserving value requires relationships and teamwork with others, and a Protector is collaborative. Protectors know that relationships are everything and that through teamwork, more can be accomplished. Protectors avoid the underuse of collaboration, where they might be isolated, antagonistic, and hoard information. Protectors avoid the overuse of collaboration, where work becomes a social club, and nobody owns outcomes.
Stable
VUCA and Disconnection are fundamentally “destabilizing” forces, and a Protector brings stability to the organization. Protectors strive to bring stability against the volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) realities. Protectors strive to be conscientious and careful. Protectors strive to be calm and detached from turmoil. Protectors avoid the underuse of stability, where they might be neurotic, chaotic, and “caught up” in drama. Protectors avoid the overuse of stability, where they might appear not to care.
Accountable
Too many people blame others and pass the buck because “it’s not my job,” and a Protector brings accountability. Protectors know that they can always be more accountable and take ownership of more. Protectors avoid the underuse of accountability, where they might blame others, wait for others, and say, "it's not my job!". Protectors avoid the overuse of accountability, where they might step on toes, micromanage and potentially move beyond the scope.
Visionary
Dealing with obstacles and obligations can distract from the big picture, so a Protector brings vision to the organization. Protectors know that being purposeful, optimistic, and focusing on the long game is critical. Protectors avoid underuse where they might become myopic, and pessimistic (even cynical!), and focus on the short game. Protectors avoid overuse where they might become too abstract, too naive, and without an end in sight.
Versatile
Wicked problems require an interdisciplinary approach, and a Protector Mindset™ brings a versatile skillset to the solution. Protectors strive to integrate Critical Disciplines to approach their work from multiple dimensions using the Protector Skillset™. Protectors avoid the underuse of versatility where they might myopically have a "hammer, and everything looks like a nail." Protectors avoid the overuse of versatility, where they might create overly complicated solutions that never get implemented.
Proactive
The modern economy moves fast, and the Protector knows that being proactive helps win the day. Protectors know that being proactive reduces the risk of being caught off guard, helps to correct errors, and be more courageous. Protectors avoid the underuse of proactivity, where they might become “clueless,” paralyzed, or cowardly. Protectors avoid the overuse of proactivity, where they might leap without looking or, too frequently, change without ever reaching a steady state.


The Protector Skillset™
GRC Professionals integrate the Critical Disciplines into their Protector Skillset™ to leverage the strengths of each discipline to fill gaps and accelerate success.

      * Plan for risks
      * Identify risks
      * Assess risks
      * Address risks
      * Measure and monitor risks
      * Use decision science and support techniques
Compliance & Ethics
Compliance & Ethics skills include ways to address obligations and the risks associated with both mandatory and voluntary boundaries. These skills help the organization to:
      * Identify mandatory obligations
      * Identify and formalize voluntary obligations
      * Assess compliance and ethics risk
      * Set policy and procedures
      * Educate and communicate with the workforce
      * Inspire and shape an ethical culture
Security & Continuity
Security & Continuity skills include ways to address significant risks and crises, especially those areas of the organization prone to attack or existential consequences. These skills help the organization to:
      * Identify critical physical and digital assets
      * Assess related risks
      * Address related risks
      * Measure and monitor related risks
      * Use scenario planning and simulation to practice response
      * Identify technology recovery and business resumption strategies
      * Perform crisis response when appropriate
Audit & Assurance
Audit & Assurance skills include ways to enhance the confidence of internal and external stakeholders that the organization is designed and operating effectively to reliably achieve objectives, address uncertainty, and act with integrity. These skills help the organization to:
      * Prioritize assurance activities
      * Plan, perform, report, and monitor assessments
      * Use design and substantive testing techniques
      * Communicate with stakeholders and management to enhance confidence

Using this Document
This document introduces the GRC Capability Model (the “Model”). The GRC Capability Model helps organizations reliably achieve objectives, address uncertainty, and act with integrity to produce and preserve value – to achieve Principled Performance. The GRC Capability Model describes components and elements that comprise high-performing GRC that are measured for Maturity and Total Performance.
The GRC Capability Model integrates several Critical Disciplines and presents concepts familiar to professionals skilled in Governance & Oversight, Strategy & Performance, Risk & Decision Support, Compliance & Ethics, Security & Continuity, and Audit & Assurance. 
The GRC Capability Model aims to unify, harmonize and integrate these disciplines with an internally consistent vocabulary, models, and “meta-process” that can be applied in various departments and functions. 
The GRC Capability Model aims to “guide” rather than dictate. GRC Professionals should use this Model like a cookbook rather than a chemistry set. In other words, the specific context and idiosyncrasies of each organization will necessitate adding more or less emphasis on components, elements, practices, considerations, and so forth.
Design Drivers
Several fundamental realities and drivers that influence the design of the GRC Capability Model.  


People
People are at the center of the most vexing aspects of the trillion-dollar problem.
People are the ones who commit misconduct and make mistakes and miscalculations. Even when technology is at “fault” for miscalculating, a person is behind the design and implementation of the technology.
And people are messy. People have free will (or something that looks and feels a lot like it). People are free to choose this or that or otherwise. People are free to make choices that may result in positive or negative outcomes. 
People rarely respond to top-down dictates and coercion (and if they do respond, they don’t respond for very long). Addressing this “human element” requires bottom-up, inside-out techniques.
Wicked Problems
The trillion-dollar problem of misconduct, miscalculations, and mistakes is a Wicked Problem.
A "wicked problem" is a term used in design, policy-making, and social sciences to describe a complex, dynamic, and multifaceted problem that is difficult or even impossible to solve completely. These problems are characterized by high levels of uncertainty, multiple and conflicting goals, and many interrelated and changing factors. With wicked problems, it is difficult to identify the boundaries of their impact, or recognize all the variables that are in play for a particular problem. It can even be difficult to tell if a wicked problem has been solved until many years later because it may address long-term opportunities, obstacles, and obligations.
Unlike "tame" problems that have clear solutions and can be addressed using a straightforward and linear approach, wicked problems are often characterized by a lack of clear definition, incomplete or contradictory information, and the need for ongoing adaptation and experimentation.
Solving wicked problems often requires collaboration, creativity, and innovation across multiple disciplines and stakeholders. Rather than seeking a definitive solution, the aim is to develop adaptive and flexible approaches that can respond to changing circumstances and evolving priorities.
Complex Adaptive System of Systems
Organizations, teams, and even individuals are Complex Adaptive Systems of Systems.
A "complex adaptive system of systems" (CASoS) is a type of system that is made up of many interacting subsystems, each with its own behavior, rules, and feedback loops. A CASoS is characterized by its complexity, adaptivity, and emergence, meaning that it is capable of self-organization and can exhibit emergent behaviors that are not predictable from the behavior of its individual components.
Understanding and managing CASoS requires a systems thinking approach, which considers the behavior of the system as a whole rather than just its individual components. It also requires an understanding of the interactions and feedback loops between different sub-systems, as well as an ability to anticipate and respond to emergent behaviors.
A complex adaptive system of systems is more like a flock and less like a clock. It would be ideal if all problems could be solved as easily as fixing a clock, where a solution can be immediately verified by the clock's ability to tell time again. However, the reality is that problems in CASoS cannot be solved in such a straightforward manner. The nature of such problems is dynamic and multifaceted, and solutions are not always predictable or immediately verifiable.
Fractality
Organizations comprise multiple levels and units of self-similar patterns and structures.
Fractality refers to the property of self-similarity or the repetition of patterns at different scales in a system or structure. In fractal geometry, a fractal is a mathematical set that exhibits self-similarity and has a structure that is similar at every scale. Fractals are often found in nature, such as in the branching patterns of trees, the veins of leaves, or the shapes of clouds. 
In organizations, fractality is used to describe the self-similar patterns and structures of social networks and interactions, as well as in the study of collective behavior and decision-making.
Fractality means that problems and solutions can replicate and scale to multiple levels of the organization.
  Anatomy of GRC Capabilities
The GRC Capability Model describes components and elements that comprise a high-performing GRC Capability – any part of which is measured for Maturity and Total Performance.
Components
The GRC Capability Model consists of four Components: (L) LEARN, (A) ALIGN, (P) PERFORM, and (R)REVIEW. Each Component includes its own:
         * Descriptive summary,
         * Considerations to be taken into account, and
         * Elements that are required under each Component.
Elements
There are 20 elements in the GRC Capability Model distributed among the four components: (4) Elements under the LEARN Component, (5) Elements under the ALIGN Component, (8) Elements under the PERFORM Component, and (3) Elements under the REVIEW Component. Each Element includes its own:
         * Descriptive summary,
         * Practices that describe critical activities,
         * Considerations that impact decisions, design, and operation, and
         * Tools & Techniques that may optionally be used.
Measuring GRC Capabilities
Maturity Model
A Maturity Model provides a theoretical continuum, often expressed in “levels,” along which maturity can be developed incrementally from one level to the next. Maturity levels may be used to assess how capable (prepared) the organization is to perform practices:
         * Level 1 - Initial. Practices are improvised, ad hoc, and often chaotic.
         * Level 2 - Managed. Practices are defined and managed, though sometimes informally.
         * Level 3 - Consistent. Practices are formally documented and consistently managed.
         * Level 4 - Measured. Practices are measured and managed with data-driven evidence.
         * Level 5 - Optimizing. Practices are consistently improved over time.
In some maturity models, the highest Level 5 is called “Optimized.” However, GRC Professionals recognize that an area is never “optimized” but rather in the process of “optimizing” over time.
GRC Professionals apply the concept of maturity at all levels of The GRC Capability Model as needed. 
For example, the Education Element could be assessed for Maturity:
         * Level 1 - Initial. Education practices are improvised and often chaotic.
         * Level 2 - Managed. Education Practices are defined and managed, though sometimes informally. This means the team knows how to define, develop and deliver education, but nothing is documented. And, when workers are educated, records are not always created or stored.
         * Level 3 - Consistent. Education Practices are formally documented and consistently managed. This means the team follows documented practices to define, develop and deliver education. Learner records are created and maintained.
         * Level 4 - Measured. Education Practices are measured and managed with data-driven evidence. This means that the documented process generates enough data and indicators to judge the effectiveness, efficiency, responsiveness, and resilience of Education.
         * Level 5 - Optimizing. Education Practices are consistently improved over time. This means that the indicators are not only captured and judged but that the team can demonstrate continuous improvement.
Total Performance™
For each element, the GRC Capability Model describes Total Performance across four dimensions: Effectiveness, Efficiency, Responsiveness, and Resilience. These dimensions should be considered across all components, elements, and practices.
For example, the Education Element could be assessed for Total Performance:  
         * Effective (“Sound”). Is the design of the education program logical? Does it follow best practices? Are all topical areas covered? Are the workers we intend to educate actually getting educated? Are they retaining the knowledge/skills they need? Is the education program impacting the intended business objectives?
         * Efficient (“Lean”). What does it cost to educate the workforce? Is the cost per Worker going up/down? How does this cost compare to organizations of similar size?
         * Responsive (“Agile”). How long does it take to educate a department? How long does it take to identify an education need and 100% coverage of the intended audience? When an error is found in the education program, how long does it take to be detected and corrected?
         * Resilient (“Antifragile”). What will we do if the online education system fails? What kind of slack do we have in education timelines in case of unplanned distractions? What kind of backup staff do we have in case someone gets sick?
________________
Applying the GRC Capability Model
The GRC Capability Model can be applied at any level within the organization.
         * Organization (also Organization in Scope): The organizational unit in scope for applying the GRC Capability Model. This may be the enterprise, a business unit, a department, or a team.
Organizations may be large or small, simple or complex. The organization in scope may be an entire legal entity (enterprise) or some smaller subordinate unit (business unit, department, team). While not every organization in scope has a complex hierarchy of levels, units, or layers, virtually all have some structure for reporting, accountability, and approval.
The GRC Capability Model uses these terms and concepts when referring to the Organization in Scope and its related units, levels, and layers.
Organizational Units
Organizational Unit (also Unit): A specific subdivision of an organization that is formed for the purpose of achieving particular objectives.  
         * Enterprise: The most superior unit that encompasses the entirety of the organization. The term “enterprise” may be used even when the organization is a government agency, a nonprofit organization, or a small organization.
         * Business Unit: A business unit is subordinate to the enterprise and often responsible for specific products, customers, or geography. The term “business unit” may be used even when the organization is not a “business” (e.g., a government agency or a nonprofit organization).
         * Department: A department is subordinate to the enterprise and often cuts across multiple business units providing shared services such as human resources, information technology (IT), compliance, risk management, and other services.
         * Team: A team is the smallest organizational unit. Teams may be part of a department or may be cross-functional. Teams may be permanent or temporary.
Organizational Levels
Organizational Level (also Organizational Layer): A description of the accountability relationship between units.
         * Superior Level (also Superior Unit, Superior Layer, and Superior): refers to other organizational units to which the organization in scope is accountable.
         * Subordinate Level (also Subordinate Unit, Subordinate Layer, and Subordinate): refers to other organizational units accountable to the organization in scope.
         * Peer Level (also Peer Unit, Peer Layer, and Peer): refers to organizational units that are lateral to the organization and often report to or are accountable to the same superior unit.  
Special Units and People
The GRC Capability Model refers to specialized units and people that have specific responsibilities.
            * Governing Authority (also Board): Refers to the most superior level of accountability and authority. The governing authority is often responsible for balancing the competing needs of stakeholders so that it can guide, constrain, and conscribe the organization to reliably achieve objectives, address uncertainty, and act with integrity to meet these needs. The governing authority is often a board of directors if the organization is an enterprise. (The governing authority may be an oversight committee if the organization is a business unit or department.)

            * Workforce (also Personnel): Refers to the collection of individuals the organization employs including:
               * Executives (also Executive Team or Executive Management or Executive Management Team) Senior-most managers with broad responsibilities over the entire organization or some significant part of the organization (e.g., all technology, all sales, and marketing, all administration, all finance).
               * Managers (also Management or Management Team) refer to personnel who manage others. Qualifiers such as “senior managers” refer to managers with more responsibility in scale or scope, while “junior managers” have less responsibility.
               * Staff (also Team Members) refer to more junior-level personnel who typically do not manage others.
               * Leaders (also Leadership) are individuals at any level of the organization who have the de facto attention and respect of the workforce regardless of their title or position.

                  * Third Party (or member of the Extended Enterprise): Refers to a partner that conducts substantial actions & controls on behalf of the organization. Organizations often “outsource” actions & controls to third parties to benefit from their competence while focusing the organization's efforts on its core competencies. Even when an organization outsources actions & controls, it is crucial to recognize that the organization often retains legal or reputational responsibility for any problems in the extended enterprise.
Processes & Resources
The GRC Capability Model details the capabilities that arrange processes and resources to achieve Principled Performance. These terms are used:
                  * Integrated Plan details processes and resources allocated to reliably achieve objectives, address uncertainty, and act with integrity.
                  * Process (also Ways) is a series of actions or steps to achieve an objective.
                  * Resources (also Means) include people, technology, facilities, information, financial capital, and other assets used to achieve objectives.
                  * Human Capital - Individual capabilities and relationships.
                  * Technology Capital - Hardware, software, and technology.
                  * Physical Capital - Manufactured goods and facilities.
                  * Information Capital - Data, communications, and intelligence.
                  * Financial Capital - Liquidity, budgets, and other economic resources.
________________
Getting There
An organization must implement and operate a collection of integrated capabilities (elements) that drive cooperation, coordination, and collaboration. Some organizations achieve this by keeping existing capabilities and improving integration. Other organizations may choose to develop all or many new capabilities. 
In every case, the organization must commit to the concept of Principled Performance and the allocation of resources necessary to support integrated GRC.
Key Steps
                     1. Commit. Obtain commitment to Principled Performance and GRC.
                     2. Plan. Use the GRC Capability Model to guide the design of your capabilities. 
                     3. Do. Assign accountability and implement the GRC Capability.
                     4. Check. Evaluate the execution of the GRC Capability.
                     5. Act. Use the results of the evaluation to fine-tune and improve the GRC Capability.

Starting Points  
Getting somewhere requires both a destination and a starting point. For GRC Professionals and the GRC Capability Model, the destination is the same – namely, Principled Performance. 
But to navigate, the starting point tends to be different depending on the organizational type, scale, scope, purpose, and current challenges. Moreover, even starting points may change over time. It is possible to start with a Blank Canvas and then encounter a problem that can redirect you to a Crisis starting point. Some of the starting points appear as an organization grows and matures.
Thus, while every organization is unique and requires a unique starting point, most organizations fall into one of these categories:
                     * SP0. Blank Canvas Starting Point
                     * SP1. Topical Starting Point
                     * SP2. Discipline Starting Point
                     * SP3. Element Starting Point
                     * SP4. Crisis Starting Point
SP0. Blank Canvas Starting Point
A blank canvas starting point is atypical because most organizations already have one or more elements of the GRC Capability Model. However, some organizations work “as if” there is a blank canvas so that the organization can take a step back to formalize and integrate its approach.
SP1. Topical Starting Point
A topical starting point is a project to address a category of opportunities, obstacles, or obligations. For example, you may be assigned to
                     * Implement an information security system,
                     * Implement internal control over financial reporting, or
                     * Implement an anti-corruption program.
SP2. Discipline Starting Point
A discipline starting point is a project to address one or more of the background disciplines to establish a framework or program for the organization:
                     * Governance & Oversight Framework
                     * Strategy & Performance Framework
                     * Risk Management Framework
                     * Decision-Making Framework
                     * Compliance & Ethics Framework
                     * Security Framework 
                     * Business Continuity Framework
                     * Audit & Assurance Framework
SP3. Element Starting Point
An element starting point is a project to address an element in the GRC Capability, such as:
                     * Implement a training system,
                     * Implement a policy management system,
                     * Implement a risk analysis process, or
                     * Implement an insurance program.
SP4. Crisis Starting Point
A crisis starting point is a project to address a situation that caused significant harm to the organization, such as
                     * Address a major financial scandal,
                     * Address a major workplace scandal,
                     * Address major breaches in security, 
                     * Address a major sanction, or
                     * Address a major human rights scandal.
Regardless of the starting point, the GRC Capability Model will help an organization ensure that an integrated system of components and elements work together to reliably achieve objectives, address uncertainty, and act with integrity – to achieve Principled Performance.
________________
Part I - GRC Concepts
GRC is a pathway to Principled Performance – a noble goal for every organization to “reliably achieve objectives, address uncertainty, and act with integrity.” This definition can be broken down into its major parts. 
                     * Reliably (consistently, dependably, and transparently)
                     * Achieve objectives (mission, vision, values, and balanced objectives)
                     * Address uncertainty (address opportunities and obstacles that balance risk and reward)
                     * Act with integrity (stay within boundaries to address voluntary and mandatory obligations)
These parts are used to explain the Key GRC Concepts. But before stepping into the parts, consider the big picture of what it means to “do” business. 
“Big Picture” Perspective
Every business, every organization, is designed to achieve objectives. As an organization drives toward objectives, it faces uncertain opportunities, uncertain obstacles, and mandatory and voluntary obligations.
                     * Objective – a measurable outcome to achieve.
                     * Opportunity – an uncertain event that may, on balance, positively affect objectives.
                     * Obstacle – an uncertain event that may, on balance, negatively affect objectives.
                     * Obligation (also Boundary) – a requirement that an organization must or should address.  
Managing Opportunities, Obstacles & Obligations
Addressing opportunities, obstacles, and obligations requires focus. By understanding each, a balanced approach can be used to manage these perspectives. 
Opportunities
Opportunities are generally associated with Reward, a measure of the positive, favorable effect of uncertainty on objectives. Reward is often managed using Performance Management systems and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
                        * Reward (also Performance) - A measure of the positive, favorable effect of uncertainty on objectives.
                        * Performance Management - The act of managing processes and resources to pursue reward while addressing risk.
                        * Key Performance Indicator (KPI) - Indicators designed to help govern, manage, and provide assurance about performance.  
Obstacles
Obstacles are generally associated with Risk, a measure of the negative, unfavorable effect of uncertainty on objectives. Risk is often managed using Risk Management systems and Key Risk Indicators (KRIs).
                           * Risk - A measure of the negative, unfavorable effect of uncertainty on objectives.
                           * Risk Management - The act of managing processes and resources to address risk while pursuing reward.
                           * Key Risk Indicator (KRI) - Indicators designed to help govern, manage, and provide assurance about risk.
Obligations
Obligations are generally associated with Compliance, a measure of the degree to which obligations and requirements are addressed. Compliance is often managed using Compliance Management systems and Key Compliance Indicators (KCIs).
                           * Compliance - a measure of the degree to which obligations are proven to be addressed.
                           * Compliance Management - the act of managing processes and resources to achieve the desired level of compliance.
                           * Key Compliance Indicator (KCI) - Indicators designed to help govern, manage, and provide assurance about compliance.
NOTE:  To clarify, Performance Management and KPIs are described “classic” meaning – they are typically used to address opportunities and reward. That said, some GRC Professionals note that KPIs may also be used more generally to address opportunities, obstacles and obligations. In other words, the label “KPI” is sometimes used more generally for “all types of indicators.”
Some GRC Professionals note that the entire GRC approach is about Total Performance and Principled Performance. Thus, one might imagine using Key Total Performance Indicators (KTPIs) or Key Principled Performance Indicators (KPPIs) to encompass ALL types of indicators including “classic” performance indicators and performance management systems.
Regardless of which approach is used to label indicators and management systems, it can be helpful to understand these three perspectives.


Governance, Management & Assurance
Beyond managing these perspectives, an organization must also govern and provide assurance around performance (reward), risk, and compliance. Thus a complete picture of this approach is the governance, management, and assurance of performance, risk, and compliance.  
GRC and the GRC Capability Model guide the governance, management, and assurance of performance (reward), risk, and compliance to reliably achieve objectives, address uncertainty, and act with integrity.
Decisions & Error Correction
The GRC Capability Model is fundamentally about making better decisions. In several areas, decision-making criteria is used so that decisions are more consistent and aligned with the organization’s purpose.
                           * Decision-Making Criteria - are the principles, values, rules, variables, conditions, targets, tolerances, and other thresholds used to select an option or make a decision.
                           * Direction-Setting Criteria - are criteria used to set the direction for the organization and its objectives based on external/internal context, culture, and stakeholder needs.
                           * Objective-Setting Criteria - are criteria used to set objectives and key results in accordance with the organization’s direction.
                           * Identification Criteria - are criteria used to identify opportunities, obstacles, and obligations that stand in front of the organization and its objectives. 
                           * Analysis Criteria - are criteria used to analyze, quantify and select ways to address risk, reward, and compliance.
                           * Design Criteria - are criteria used to select actions & controls that address risk, reward, and compliance.
“Reliably”
Principled Performance requires an organization to reliably achieve objectives, address uncertainty, and act with integrity. 
Reliability applies to all other parts of the Principled Performance definition and means to:
                           * Reliably achieve objectives
                           * Reliably address uncertainty
                           * Reliably act with integrity
Reliability is all about being consistent, dependable, and transparent. And to be all these things, GRC integrates the governance, management, and assurance of performance, risk, and compliance.
Management & Governance Provide Reliability
Management and governance are economic functions that support each other. The difference between the two is the relationship between the person doing the management/governance and the thing being managed/governed. 
                           * Management is the act of directly guiding, controlling, and evaluating an entity, process, or resource by arranging and operating resources.
                           * Governance is the act of indirectly guiding, controlling, and evaluating an entity, process, or resource by constraining and conscribing resources.
Management has direct contact with the thing being managed. Thus, managing something involves direct actions & controls that arrange and operate resources. For example, a CIO has direct contact with and control over the IT department. The CIO “manages” the IT department by establishing policies and arranging resources to achieve departmental (and enterprise) objectives. 
Governance has indirect contact with the thing being managed. Thus, governing something involves indirect actions & controls that constrain and conscribe resources. For example, the Board has indirect contact with and control over the IT department. The Board may “govern” IT resources by establishing policies and limits constraining what the CIO may do.
Sometimes, these economic functions overlap; and sometimes, it is unclear if an action or control primarily serves a governance or management purpose. In fact, some actions & controls serve both. Despite this ambiguity and potential overlap, it is helpful to distinguish between these two economic functions.
Assurance Provides Reliability
Those managing and governing the organization need to know that what they believe is happening actually is happening and that it is working. Assurance provides this confidence to management, the governing authority, and other stakeholders. 
                           * Assurance - the act of objectively and competently evaluating subject matter to provide justified conclusions and confidence that statements and beliefs about the subject matter are true.
                           * Evaluate - the act of judging subject matter by comparing evidence against suitable criteria.
                           * Subject Matter - identifiable statements, conditions, events, or activities for which there is evidence.
                           * Suitable Criteria - benchmarks used to evaluate subject matter that yield consistent and meaningful results.
                           * Information Consumer (also Information User) - an individual, group or any entity that receives information sent from any source within the organization. Information is utilized as evidence to evaluate and compare against given criteria to provide a certain level of assurance.
                           * Information Producer - an individual, group or any entity that produces data/information to send to another individual, group or entity that requests such information for the purpose of providing assurance.
Assurance is never absolute. It is common for GRC Professionals to specify a desired “level of assurance” about some subject matter. The Level of Assurance about something is a function of the Assurance Objectivity and Assurance Competence of the Assurance Provider.
                           * Assurance Provider - someone who conducts assurance activities.
                           * Assurance Objectivity - the degree to which an Assurance Provider can be impartial, disinterested, independent, and free to conduct necessary activities and to form an opinion about the subject matter.
                           * Assurance Competence - the degree to which an Assurance Provider can use sophisticated, professional, and structured techniques to evaluate the subject matter.
A greater degree of Assurance Objectivity and a greater degree of Assurance Competence generally result in a higher Level of Assurance.
                           * Level of Assurance - a measure of the degree of confidence that an assurance provider can deliver to an information consumer about statements an information provider makes about subject matter.  
Not everything requires a high level of assurance. For example, a manager in the sales department may want “some” assurance that the way they conduct sales calls is sound. For this lower level of assurance, they might call five colleagues in other companies and ask about their process. Then use that information with the sales team to identify gaps.
The VP of sales, on the other hand, might want a “higher” level of assurance that all sales teams are using best practices to conduct sales calls. This might entail hiring an outside expert, using a vetted sales call maturity model, to conduct design and operational testing of controls used in the sales process.
                              * Absolute Assurance - a level of assurance that is impossible to achieve.
                              * Reasonable Assurance - a special type of assurance, provided by external auditors as part of a financial audit or examination, that subject matter conforms to suitable criteria and is free from material error.
                              * Limited Assurance - a level of assurance resulting from reviews, compilations, and other activities performed by competent personnel who are sufficiently objective about the subject matter.
                              * Lower Assurance - a more limited level of assurance resulting from activities such as self-assessments and benchmarking performed by the personnel responsible for the subject matter.
The terms "independent" or "independence" are occasionally used in reference to assurance to emphasize the importance of the structural or reporting relationship between the assurance provider, the information producer, and the information consumer. The notion is that the assurance provider should have a structurally independent status, with either no reporting relationship to the information producer or a dual reporting relationship, to enhance objectivity.
However, independence alone does not guarantee objectivity and is simply a means to achieve it. 
Therefore, a GRC Professional must recognize that independence is a tool to achieve objectivity. Independence is not synonymous with objectivity, and may not be recommended given a target level of assurance.
For example, when a high level of assurance is desired (e.g., evaluating internal control over financial reporting), it may be beneficial for the assurance provider to be independent of the information producer. When a lower level of assurance is desired (e.g., benchmarking one’s own work), independence may not be required or recommended.
Hence, it is important to note that independence should not be confused with objectivity, as they are related concepts, but independence alone does not guarantee objectivity and is not always recommended.
Lines of Accountability™ Provide Reliability
The Lines of Accountability Model helps organizations identify structures and processes that facilitate the governance, management, and assurance of performance, risk, and compliance by focusing on the contribution each “line” makes to producing value and preserving value. 
                              * First Line - Individuals and Teams that own and manage performance, risk, and compliance associated with day-to-day operational activities.

                              * Second Line - Individuals and Teams that establish performance, risk, and compliance programs for the First Line. The Second Line may include an organizational service center or staff within risk, compliance, HR, internal audit, and technology departments. The Second Line provides oversight through frameworks, standards, policies, tools, and techniques to suppor the First Line. The Second Line often manages its own portfolio of objectives and associated performance, risk, and compliance. The Second Line may provide limited assurance over First Line activities, depending on the objectivity and competence related to the subject matter.

                              * Third Line - Individuals and Teams that provide a high level of assurance on activities performed by the First Line and Second Line. The Third Line may include internal audit, external audit or outside experts who are sufficiently objective and competent. The level of assurance possible depends on the objectivity and competence related to the subject matter.

                              * Fourth Line - The Executive Team is accountable and responsible for the organization-wide performance, risk, and compliance. The Fourth Line gains information from the First Line and the Second Line and assurance from the Third Line to make decisions about managing performance, risk, and compliance. 

                              * Fifth Line - The Governing Authority (Board) is ultimately accountable and responsible for the governance, management, and assurance of performance, risk, and compliance. While the governing authority may choose to delegate, this plenary accountability means that the governing authority must use due care to ensure that the right systems are in place to learn about and address important issues – especially those that present “red flags.”


  

The lines of accountability are not static and should be used according to the unique needs of an organization. 
For example, the Third Line isn’t the only line of accountability that can provide assurance. 
Assurance on First Line activities may be provided by the Second Line so long as the activities under examination were not designed or performed by the Second Line. This depends on the degree of Assurance Objectivity and Assurance Competence the Second Line personnel have relative to the subject matter and the desired Level of Assurance. 
Likewise, the First Line may conduct assurance activities over a third party (vendor) it engages to perform day-to-day operational activities.
Also, recall that many concepts in the GRC Capability Model are fractal. While the Lines of Accountability Model is presented using five lines, the reality is that organizations comprise unique and idiosyncratic arrangements of people, processes, information, and technology.
A sole proprietor may “physically” have just one “line” in their organization – namely, themselves. Despite this arrangement, the Lines of Accountability Model may be applied by thoughtfully segregating activities in time and space by just one person. 
For example, the sole proprietor may perform daily bookkeeping with an aim toward efficiency and accuracy (first line). Then, once a month, and though not completely objective, this same person may perform “desk checking” and review of their own work (second line). Quarterly, they may conduct some strategic planning and review (fourth line). A meticulous sole proprietor may even take a weekend at the end of the year to trace transactions to perform assurance activities (third line) before preparing materials for an external auditor. And being a board member (fifth line), this same person may perform some “ultimate accountability” activities by filing the annual report to keep the organization in good standing with the tax authority.
Contrast this with a global enterprise with many business units and dozens of lines of accountability with varying degrees of scope and scale. Each business unit may have multiple lines of accountability, providing varying degrees of service to other departments and business units. 
Hence, every organization will have a unique arrangement of the Lines of Accountability based on the size, scope, and preferences of the board and executive management. What is critical is that the arrangement helps the organization be reliable.
________________
“Achieve Objectives”
Principled Performance requires an organization to reliably achieve objectives, address uncertainty, and act with integrity. 
Everything in GRC flows from objectives – and objectives flow from the expectations of stakeholders. 
Objectives should be clearly defined at multiple levels and timescales, linked with one another, and cascaded throughout the organization. Objectives must be intentional. Accidental achievement does not count toward Principled Performance.
Objectives work with Indicators to be specific, measurable, achievable (yet aspirational), relevant, and timebound (SMART Criteria).
Stakeholder Needs & Wants
There are several categories of stakeholders which have various needs and wants that drive stakeholder expectations. These expectations inform the mission, vision and objectives of the organization. 
                                 * Stakeholder - a self-legitimizing person, group, or other entity with a direct or indirect stake in the organization's actions because of actual or perceived impact.
                                 * External stakeholders - stakeholders with an external influence on the organization:
                                 * Customers (the most important external stakeholder), 
                                 * Shareholders (fractional owners who are not involved in the organization), 
                                 * Creditors and lenders, 
                                 * Suppliers, 
                                 * Underwriters, 
                                 * Government, 
                                 * Non-governmental organizations, 
                                 * Media, and 
                                 * Society.
                                 * Internal stakeholders - stakeholders with an internal influence from within the organization:
                                 * Personnel (and unions that represent the workforce), 
                                 * Managers, 
                                 * Executives, 
                                 * Board members, and 
                                 * Owners (owners who are involved in the organization).

                                    * Customer - A special type of external stakeholder. Every organization exists to serve a customer, and it is the customer who judges value. For commercial enterprises, a customer is an individual or entity that purchases products or services. For departments or teams, the customer may include a superior, subordinate, or peer organizational unit. For governmental entities, the customer is a constituent or regulated entity. In any case, the customer judges whether the organization is producing, protecting, or destroying value.
An organization must balance the expectations of these diverse stakeholders – especially when stakeholder expectations are in conflict.
                                    * Stakeholder Expectation - is a general term that refers to what a stakeholder requests, wants, needs, or expects from the organization.
Objectives & Objective-Setting
In the most general sense, an objective is simply something to achieve. And this “something” may be at any timescale, may apply to any level of the organization, or may apply to a topic or theme. 
                                    * Objective - a measurable outcome to achieve (“something to achieve”)
                                    * Indicator - a measure of progress toward or status of an objective
Objectives should be memorable, qualitative descriptions of what the organization wants to achieve. Objectives should be short, inspirational, and engaging. Indicators measure progress toward, or status of an objective.
Sometimes, modifiers indicate a specific department or topic for the objective, such as Compliance Objective or Reporting Objective. Sometimes, modifiers indicate a specific timescale for the objective, such as Annual, Quarterly, Monthly, or Daily objectives. 
Sometimes modifiers are added to an objective to indicate superior or subordinate importance, such as Strategic Objective versus Tactical Objective or Operational Objective. 
Note that one organizational unit’s “strategic objective” may be another unit’s “tactical objective.” For example, a compliance department might have a strategic objective called “Improve Compliance Program Coverage” to make sure that all relevant compliance areas have been addressed. While a compliance program and its coverage is incredibly important for the enterprise, this objective might be just one of many tactics the organization uses to meet an Enterprise Objective called “Enhance Integrity.”
Sometimes, modifiers indicate a specific level of the organization:
                                    * Enterprise Objective
                                    * Department Objective
                                    * Team Objective
                                    * Individual Objective
Often, though not always, objectives at superior levels of the organization are associated with a longer timescale. Thus, Enterprise Objectives are often Enterprise Long-Term Strategic Objectives, and Department Objectives are often Department Near-Term Tactical Objectives.
The use of modifiers doesn’t change the fundamental nature of an objective – namely, “something to achieve.”
  

Writing Objectives
Well-written objectives comprise a specific verb and a noun (object of the verb). Using simple and direct language facilitates understanding and alignment. 
Often, objectives are written to inspire progress using verbs such as “increase,” “decrease,” or “improve,” or “enhance.” Achieving these objectives will “Change the Organization (CTO)” in some way – and produce new value.
                                    * Increase Revenue
                                    * Grow Customer Base
                                    * Increase Recurring Revenue
                                    * Increase Scale of System Performance
                                    * Increase Efficiency of XYZ
                                    * Increase Effectiveness of XYZ
                                    * Increase Responsiveness of XYZ
                                    * Increase Resilience of XYZ 
Sometimes, objectives are written to “maintain” or “Run the Organization (RTO).” RTOs allow an organization to maintain what it has achieved – and preserve existing value.
Though seemingly boring or less inspirational, understand that RTOs are critical to managing the organization and keeping the trust of stakeholders (especially customers). Think of RTOs as the objectives related to service level agreements or promises to stakeholders. 
                                    * Maintain High Customer Satisfaction
                                    * Manage Debt Covenant Requirements
                                    * Maintain Sales Lead Volume
                                    * Maintain Conversion Rate
RTOs are often the source of future “Change the Organization” objectives. For example, a customer service department may begin with a Manage the Organization objective of “Maintain High Customer Satisfaction and use Net Promoter Score as an indicator. If the indicator falls outside the target, appetite, tolerance or capacity; then “Change the Organization” objectives may be defined in a subsequent period to resolve issues and elevate performance, such as:
                                    * Improve Customer Satisfaction
                                    * Improve Customer Loyalty
                                    * Reduce Customer Support Hold Time
Change the Organization and Run the Organization objectives work together to align the workforce with Mission, Vision, Values and Strategic Goals, that:
                                    * Produce New Value
                                    * Preserve Existing Value
                                    * Increase Accountability & Transparency
Ownership
Each objective must have a clear accountability structure. A single, ultimate owner should be assigned to each objective, and provided with the necessary resources and authority to ensure its successful achievement.
Allocating ownership to multiple people may result in ambiguity and should be avoided. 
For example, the Maintain Customer Satisfaction objective could be part of both the customer service department but also part of the Executive Team. However, regardless of where that objective appears, a single, ultimate owner should be assigned to the success and status of the objective. In this instance, the Executive Team may monitor the indicators associated with “Maintain Customer Satisfaction” but the customer service department would likely have ownership and resources to meet the objective.
Mission & Vision
Mission & Vision are special objectives that apply to all levels of the organization, and represent the longest-term view of what the organization strives to achieve. Mission & Vision are part of the organization’s overall Direction and purpose.
                                    * Mission: An objective that states who the organization serves, what it does, and what it hopes to achieve today and in the long term. The mission statement is often used to guide decision-making and priority-setting within the organization, and serves as a clear and consistent statement of its overall purpose and direction.
                                    * Vision: An aspirational objective that states what the organization aspires to be and why it matters. The vision is often used to inspire and motivate employees, stakeholders, and customers and serves as a guidepost for long-term strategic planning.
  

Strategic Goals
Strategic Goals are long-term objectives that reflect the strategic themes and priorities for the organization.  Strategic Goals are part of the organization’s overall Direction and used by executive management and the board to guide the overall enterprise.
Strategic Goals should balance different perspectives or areas of focus. One popular framework, the Balanced Scorecard, typically includes four perspectives: financial, customer, internal processes, and learning and growth. 
Regardless of which framework or model is used, it is important to balance short-term and long-term timescales, financial and non-financial goals, and goals related to stakeholders, customers, internal processes, and learning and growth.
Alignment
It is important for objectives to align throughout the organization. Superior-level objectives should “cascade” to subordinate units to ensure that subordinate units contribute to the most important objectives and priorities of the organization. Changes in superior-level objectives should trigger changes in subordinate-level objectives.
That said, this is bi-directional.
Daily progress and feedback gathered on subordinate-level objectives bubbles up and updates superior-level objectives. For example, progress that is slower or quicker at a subordinate level might indicate that the superior-level objective is in jeopardy or not being achieved or that the objective is in error.   
Mapping
Besides cascading down and bubbling up objectives, it is helpful to map objectives to one another. Mapping shows how (or at least if) objectives impact one another. This means mapping not only UP to superior units and DOWN to subordinate units but also ACROSS the organization to peer units and DIAGONALLY to superior and subordinate units in other areas of the organization. 
Sophisticated mapping quantifies how objectives influence one another. For example, an enterprise objective may cascade to objectives in separate subordinate units (Unit A and Unit B). The mapping may conclude that Unit A influences the enterprise objective by 75% and Unit B by 25%. Understanding this relative influence helps to allocate resources to achieve the enterprise objective.
________________
Visibility
Superior units do not need visibility over all of the objectives of subordinate units and vice versa. Sometimes, objectives can and should be localized to a single organizational unit.   
For example, a strategic goal (enterprise objective) E1 may map to several other Enterprise objectives E2, E3, and E4. Suppose that E2 cascades to Department A’s objective DA1. Within the department, DA1 is mapped to DA2, DA3, and DA4. In this way, the Executive Team at the Enterprise Level has visibility into department objective DA1 but doesn’t necessarily need to (or want to) have visibility into the other department objectives.
Further, suppose that E4 cascades to Department A and Department B, linking to DA4 and DB1. In this instance, DA4 and DB1 are visible at the enterprise level. And, because these departments contribute to the same superior-level objective, their activities are coordinated to deliver value to the organization.
In this situation, the enterprise level would only have visibility into DA1, DA4, and DB1. The other subordinate-level objectives are things that do not directly map to the enterprise level.
Indicators
Indicators measure progress toward or status of objectives. Indicators must be linked to at least one and potentially multiple objectives.
                                    * Indicator - a measure of progress toward or status of an objective.
                                    * Leading Indicators - an indicator that provides information about future events or conditions.
                                    * Lagging Indicators - an indicator that provides information about past events or conditions.
Writing Indicators
A well-written indicator includes:
                                    * Title - Descriptive name for the indicator
                                    * Metric - Quantitative measure or standard
                                    * Current Value
                                    * Target Value for this period
                                    * Starting Value at the beginning of this period 
Using a Customer Satisfaction example, objectives and indicators might be elaborated:
                                    * OBJECTIVE: Enhance Customer Satisfaction
                                    * Title: Customer Satisfaction Rating (NPS)
                                    * Metric: Net Promoter Score (NPS)
                                    * Current Value: 82
                                    * Target Value (this month): 85
                                    * Starting Value (this month): 79
Types of Indicators
Indicators measure several aspects of progress or status associated with an objective:
                                    * Key Performance Indicator (KPI) - Indicators that help govern, manage, and provide assurance about performance related to an objective.
                                    * Key Risk Indicator (KRI) - Indicators that help govern, manage, and provide assurance about risk related to an objective.
                                    * Key Compliance Indicator (KCI) - Indicators that help govern, manage, and provide assurance about compliance related to an objective.
Not every objective needs performance, risk, and compliance indicators. Some objectives and areas of the organization may only require KPIs.
For example, an organization that has a strategic goal to “Create Loyal Customers” will formulate objectives and indicators such as:
                                    * STRATEGIC GOAL: Create Loyal Customers
                                    * OBJECTIVE: Enhance Customer Satisfaction
                                    * KPI: Net Promoter Score (NPS) provides a lagging indicator of customer satisfaction and loyalty.
                                    * KRI: Number of Customer Complaints provides a leading indicator that might result in a reduction of NPS or other problems, especially if this value is high or increasing.
                                    * OBJECTIVE: Increase Long-Term Contracts
                                    * KPI: Customers on Long Term Contracts provides a lagging indicator of how many customers are on the new long-term contracts
                                    * KCI:% Customers on Long Term Contracts Consent is a lagging indicator that tracks whether or not the customer consented to enter into a new long term contract.
                                    * OBJECTIVE: Meet & Maintain Service Levels
                                    * KCI: Website Uptime Score
                                    * KCI: Website Speed Score
In this last part of the example, note that Website Uptime and Website Speed Score are classified as Key Compliance Indicators because, in this instance, the objective is to Meet & Maintain Service Levels. The Indicators are NOT being used for improving performance or to Change the Organization (CTO). Rather, they are being used to Run the Organization (RTO) and to meet the service level agreements.
But remember, well-written Indicators also include target and timescale. Some objectives and indicators require additional sophistication and use ranges for appetite, tolerance, and capacity.
Targets, Appetite, Tolerance & Capacity
All indicators should detail a target value and timescale within which the target is expected to be met. Sometimes, it is helpful to define the acceptable upper and lower range of appetite, tolerance, and capacity related to the target.
                                    * Target - An expected or planned value for an indicator.
                                    * Timescale - The expected or planned time frame to meet a target.
                                    * Appetite - A range that defines a preferred level of variation around a target. 
                                    * Tolerance - A range that defines an acceptable, though not preferred, level of variation around a target the organization is willing and able to address.
                                    * Capacity - A range that defines the absolute level of variation around a target that the organization is unwilling and unable to address; and may result in jeopardy or ruin.
The appetite is a narrow range of variation around the target that defines limits to what the organization prefers as it drives toward objectives. The tolerance is a wider range around the target that defines limits to what the organization is willing and able to address. The capacity is the most extreme range, defining limits beyond which the organization is unable to address, and may result in jeopardy of ruin.   
Values within the appetite typically don’t trigger a response from the organization. They represent “business as usual.” Values beyond the appetite but within the tolerance typically trigger planned responses to bring the organization back within the appetite. Values beyond the tolerance often trigger significant responses either to bring the organization back within tolerance (ideally back within appetite) or to cease operations. The most important purpose of this response is to avoid reaching the limits of capacity – and to avoid jeopardy or ruin.
One-Sided Indicators
Not all indicators require this sophistication. And some indicators are practically “one-sided,” having neither an upper nor a lower limit for appetite, tolerance and capacity.
For example, there is typically no upper limit for Customer Satisfaction. The higher, the better. So, in this case, there might only be lower limits set for appetite, tolerance and capacity. That said, having 100% of customers rating 100% customer satisfaction should raise suspicions – so even this example suggests that certain limits may help identify potential problems.
Take the indicator of Customer Complaints. For this there is no real lower limit. Ideally, this number will be as low as possible, so upper limits may be the only ones defined. And a total lack of customer complaints may indicate problems with the people, process or technology designed to identify and address customer complaints.  
When an indicator is “one-sided,” consider thinking about targets and limits as:
                                    * Committed Value: a value that is likely to be achieved given current assumptions and planned execution. When used, this is synonymous with Target.
                                    * Best Possible Value: a value that is likely to be achieved under the best possible assumptions and best possible execution.
                                    * Stretch Value: a value that is unlikely to be achieved, but still possible.
In the example of Customer Service:
                                    * OBJECTIVE: Enhance Customer Satisfaction
                                    * INDICATOR: Customer Satisfaction Rating (NPS), Monthly
                                    * COMMITTED TARGET (this month): 80TARGET RANGE: 78 - 82; BEST POSSIBLE: 85
                                    * STRETCH VALUE: 90
                                    * TOLERANCE: <78 thru 60 triggers response
                                    * CAPACITY: <60 triggers jeopardy and extreme response

“Address Uncertainty”
Principled Performance requires an organization to reliably achieve objectives, address uncertainty, and act with integrity. 
Uncertainty can arise from various sources, including incomplete data, conflicting information, unpredictable circumstances, and unknown future developments. It is an inherent part of everyday life. Addressing uncertainty involves making decisions based on incomplete or imperfect information, weighing the risk and reward of different options, and adapting to changing circumstances as new information becomes available.
Addressing uncertainty is about making decisions about potential opportunities and obstacles that may arise while pursuing objectives. Decisions under uncertainty involve both upside and downside – both favorable and unfavorable effects on objectives.
GRC Capability Model uses terms and definitions consistent with decision science and quantitative methods. These disciplines use clear language to describe the upside and downside of uncertainty. 
                                       * Uncertainty: A state of being unsure about something due to incomplete knowledge or underlying randomness making it difficult to understand with complete confidence.
                                       * Opportunity (Prospect): an uncertain future event that may, on balance, have a positive effect on objectives.
                                       * Obstacle (Threat): an uncertain future event that may, on balance, have a negative effect on objectives.  
Cause & Consequence
Taking a step back, uncertainty can be illustrated simply by considering causes, events, and consequences. A future, uncertain event (or condition) might have many causes. And, once the event occurs, many consequences might follow.
The likelihood is a measure of the chance of an event occurring. The impact measures the economic and non-economic consequences of the event. Taken together, the effect of uncertainty on objectives is a function of the likelihood and impact of an event.
                                          * Condition - a state of reality.
                                          * Event - something that happens, including a behavior or change in condition.
                                          * Cause (Source) - the trigger or potential trigger of events that lead to a consequence.
                                          * Consequence - the outcome or potential outcome of an event.
                                          * Effect - a measure that estimates the likelihood and impact of an event.
                                          * Likelihood - a measure that estimates the occurrence of an event.
                                          * Impact - a measure that estimates the consequence of an event.
________________
  


In reality, this model of cause → event → consequence is more complex and fractal, involving repeating events that cause other events and other events and so on.  


Likelihood and impact are rarely (if ever) single values. When considering causes and consequences, there are often distributions that are useful when using quantitative methods. Distributions more realistically model situations such as, “It is more likely that a $1 problem will occur but less likely that a $100 problem will occur.” 
Not all distributions are the same, and each situation should consider using distributions that suit situations: discrete versus continuous; bounded versus unbounded; parametric versus nonparametric; and univariate versus multivariate.  
Classifying the Effect of Uncertainty
Classifying the effect of uncertainty on objectives, and the underlying event, as either positive or negative, is dependent on the objectives. Classification isn’t always easy or even possible. Events may be ambiguous, with BOTH positive and negative consequences relative to objectives. 
Positive  
The positive, favorable effect of uncertainty on objectives is called reward. And the causes that have the potential to eventually result in benefits are called prospects.
                                          * Prospect - a cause that has the potential to eventually result in benefit.
                                          * Opportunity - an event that may, on balance, have a positive effect on objectives.
                                          * Benefit - a measure of the positive impact on the organization.
                                          * Performance (Reward) - a measure of the positive, favorable effect of uncertainty on objectives.
                                          * Performance (Reward) Management - the act of managing processes and resources to pursue reward while addressing risk.
Negative
The negative, unfavorable effect of uncertainty on objectives is called risk. And the causes that have the potential to eventually result in harm/damage are called hazards or threats.
                                          * Hazard - a cause that has the potential to eventually result in harm.
                                          * Obstacle (Threat) - an event that may, on balance, have a negative effect on objectives.
                                          * Harm (Damage) - a measure of the negative impact on the organization.
                                          * Risk - a measure of the negative, unfavorable effect of uncertainty on objectives.
                                          * Risk Management - the act of managing processes and resources to address risk while pursuing reward.
Note that for both positive and negative circumstances, neutral language may be used to describe causes, events, and consequences. But at times, it can be helpful to be more specific by using specialized terminology.
Addressing the Situation
Addressing uncertainty means confronting reality and doing something about it. There are several broad design options that an organization can use to address an opportunity, obstacle, or obligation:
                                          * Avoid Design Option - cease all activity or terminate sources that give rise to the opportunity, obstacle, or obligation.
                                          * Accept Design Option - embrace or concede to the situation with minor modifications and awareness about the nature and level of risk/reward and compliance associated with the opportunity, obstacle, or obligation.
                                          * Share Design Option - outsource, joint venture, partner, buy insurance, or use other financial instruments to address the opportunity, obstacle, or obligation (NOTE: TRANSFER is a special case of SHARING where an attempt is made to give close to 100% of consequence to another party such as an insurance company).
                                          * Control Design Option- implement actions that govern and manage the opportunity, obstacle, or obligation according to its nature:
                                          * Opportunities
                                          * Promote the occurrence of the event or event causes
                                          * Detect the event as soon as possible
                                          * Compound the consequences to accelerate and increase the positive impact
                                          * Obstacles
                                          * Prevent the occurrence of the event or event causes
                                          * Detect the event as soon as possible and accelerate the correction and recovery
                                          * Correct the event and reduce the negative impact
                                          * Recover from any negative impact
                                          * Obligations
                                          * Cover each requirement with at least one action and control
                                          * Layer requirements with multiple actions & controls to get appropriate depth
                                          * Detect any adherence/violations (noncompliance) as soon as possible to accelerate remediation
Controlling the Situation
An organization implements actions & controls to modify the inherent effect of uncertainty, to realize a residual effect that is acceptable. 
                                          * Inherent Effect - the effect of uncertainty in the absence of actions & controls.
                                          * Residual Effect - the effect of uncertainty in the presence of actions & controls.
The causes and consequences of risk and reward are addressed differently. In the case of reward, the organization tries to promote favorable causes and compound benefits as soon as possible. In the case of risk, the organization tries to deter and prevent causes and correct and recover from harm as soon as possible.  
Note that the binomial “actions and controls” is used because not everything is a control. Sometimes a single action or decision is used to address a situation.
                                          * Actions & Controls - Specific arrangements of people, processes, technology, or information intended to modify risk, reward or compliance.
                                          * Proactive Actions & Controls promote favorable events and deter and prevent unfavorable events.
                                          * Detective Actions & Controls detect the occurrence of favorable events and unfavorable events.
                                          * Responsive Actions & Controls compound the effect of favorable events, and correct and recover from unfavorable events.
And, while true for both risk and reward, it is most common to use inherent and residual terminology when talking about risk.
                                          * Inherent Risk - the level of risk in the absence of actions & controls.
                                          * Residual Risk - the level of risk in the presence of actions & controls.

  

“Act with Integrity”
Principled Performance requires an organization to reliably achieve objectives, address uncertainty, and act with integrity. 
Reliably achieving objectives and addressing uncertainty is pointless unless the organization acts with integrity – addressing its obligations to operate within mandatory and voluntary boundaries.
One way to think about integrity is to consider it as a ration of Promises Kept divided by Promises Made. The more Promises Kept, the closer this ratio is to 1 or 100%.  
                                             * Integrity - The state of being whole and complete by fulfilling obligations, honoring promises, and cleaning up the mess if a promise was broken.
                                             * Obligation (also Boundary) - a requirement that an organization must or should address because of a promise, whether mandatory or voluntary.
                                             * Mandatory Obligation (Mandatory Requirement, Mandatory Boundary) - obligations that an organization must address because of some legitimate authority (e.g., laws, rules, regulations).
                                             * Voluntary Obligation (Voluntary Requirement, Voluntary Boundary) - obligations that an organization chooses to address because of voluntary decisions (e.g., contracts, agreements and values).
                                             * Compliance - a measure of the degree to which obligations are proven to be addressed.
                                             * Compliance Management - the act of managing processes and resources to achieve the desired level of compliance.
________________
Measuring compliance in a particular area must start with:  
                                             * Requirements
                                             * Actions & controls to address requirements
                                             * Evidence that actions & controls are effectively designed and operating.
Since compliance is a measure, there can be both lower and higher levels of compliance. A low level of compliance means that a requirement is EITHER or BOTH:
                                             * Not in fact, addressed by effective actions & controls
                                             * Not in evidence, addressed by effective actions & controls
High level of compliance, on the other hand, means that a requirement is BOTH:
                                             * In fact, addressed by effective actions & controls
                                             * In evidence, addressed by effective actions & controls
Put more simply, high compliance requires that the requirement is not only addressed by effective actions & controls, but that this fact has evidence to be true (documentation, records, etc.).
Duality of Compliance
Obligations present a duality – one involving risk and the other involving strictly compliance.   For example, take a mandatory obligation that a government imposes to “implement an anti-discrimination policy and training program.” This obligation is rooted in the ethical principle of “treat people fairly.” The obligation may have several requirements:
                                             * Post anti-discrimination policy in a public location
                                             * Train all hiring managers for two hours every two years
                                             * Train all employees for one hour every two years
Complying with these requirements might involve actions & controls such as:
                                             * Policy – Anti-harassment policy. Additions to the Code of Conduct.
                                             * People – Schedule and conduct manager and workforce training.
                                             * Technology - Implement policy management and education management systems.
But beyond compliance, there are also related “compliance-related risks” that must be addressed – that is, the risk that someone in the organization will be mistreated or discriminated against. 
This risk may be higher or lower than other organizations based on the unique features of the organization. If the risk of discrimination is assessed as low, the organization may decide that mere “compliance” with the mandatory obligations is adequate. If the risk of discrimination is hither, the organization may decide to enact additional actions & controls such as:
                                             * Policy – Remove all names and dates from resumes to reduce inferences about race, biological sex, and age.
                                             * People – Enhance training with scenarios and reminders throughout the year.
                                             * Process - Process hiring and promotion decisions through a centralized team to conduct diligence on the hiring and promotion decision.
                                             * Information – Make anti-discrimination one of the themes addressed in organizational communications, including top executive communications.
                                             * Financial - Purchase employment practices insurance.
Values in Action
Mandatory and voluntary boundaries are both important. But Values are an organization's most important voluntary obligations. And putting values in action is key.
In some instances, acting contrary to organizational values may negatively impact the organization much more than acting contrary to even mandated obligations. Stakeholders may agree or disagree with any one particular mandate. And it is always possible that an organization doesn’t know 100% of the mandatory obligations at a point in time.
However, unlike mandatory obligations, the organization voluntarily offers and expresses a “promise” to stakeholders. The organization knows 100% of the values it expresses. Breaking this voluntary commitment is sometimes more economically and reputationally damaging than missing the mark on other commitments.
An effective organizational values statement can help to create a shared sense of purpose and direction among the workforce, and can help to align the organization's actions and decisions with its broader mission and goals.
In this way, Values work with Mission and Vision to describe the highest purpose of the organization:
                                             * Mission - A statement that describes who the organization serves, what it does, and what it hopes to achieve today and in the long term.
                                             * Vision - A statement that describes what the organization aspires to be and why it matters.
                                             * Values - A statement about what the organization believes and stands for.
An organizational values statement typically reflects the shared beliefs and expectations of the organization's leadership, employees, and stakeholders. It serves as a guide for establishing a positive and productive organizational culture.
Organizational values statements can take many different forms, depending on the size, structure, and mission of the organization. Some values statements may be short and simple, while others may be more detailed and elaborate.
Examples of organizational values that may be included in a values statement could include accountability, collaboration, innovation, respect, and customer service. These values may be expressed through specific behaviors or actions.
Culture
Culture is important across all aspects of Principles Performance. But it plays a special role to help the organization “act with integrity.” Various aspects make up the Culture, Climate, and Mindsets. These aspects are defined for consideration when analyzing culture from different perspectives:
                                             * Culture - is an emergent property of a group expressed in observable norms resulting from the interaction of individual beliefs, values, and behaviors. (NEW: Culture is an emergent property of a group of people caused by the interaction of individual beliefs, values, mindsets, and behaviors and demonstrated by observable norms and articulated opinions that shape beliefs, values, mindsets, and behaviors in wide-ranging and durable ways.)
                                             * Mindsets - are individual perceptions about self, surroundings, and others – including perceptions about culture, some aspect of culture, or some topical area.
                                             * Climate - is the collective perception about self, surroundings, and others – including perceptions about culture, some aspect of culture, or some topical area.
                                             * Norms - are customs, rules, or expectations that a group socially reinforces. There are two types of norms:
                                             * Prescriptive Norms encourage behavior the group deems positive (e.g., “be honest”)
                                             * Proscriptive Norms discourage behavior the group deems negative (e.g., “do not cheat”)
                                             * Beliefs - are unobservable ideas and assumptions of a person or group, often caused by experience, perception, and personality.
                                             * Values - are principles that a person or group deems important usually because of beliefs.
                                             * Behaviors - are observable actions of a person or group of people, informed by beliefs and values. There are three types of behaviors:
                                             * Voluntary Behaviors are intentional human actions informed by beliefs and values and governed by free will and discipline.
                                             * Habitual Behaviors are semi-automatic human actions informed by beliefs and values and governed by free will and discipline.
                                             * Involuntary Behaviors are automatic, often instinctual human actions informed by beliefs and values and governed by nature.

Integrated Action & Control Model™  (IACM™)
The Integrated Action & Control Model (IACM) provides a structure to consider the purpose and types of actions & controls used for the governance, management, and assurance of performance, risk, and compliance.
The IACM uses a simple construct of “before, during and after, and “favorable and unfavorable events” that apply across opportunities, obstacles, and obligations to:
                                             * Decrease the effect (likelihood and impact) of unfavorable events and behaviors.
                                             * Increase the effect (likelihood and impact) of favorable events and behaviors.
Favorable and unfavorable events relate to opportunities, obstacles, and obligations. For example:
                                             * Opportunities
                                             * Favorable events: increase the ultimate likelihood and impact of benefit.
                                             * Unfavorable events: decrease the ultimate likelihood and impact of benefit.
                                             * Obstacles
                                             * Favorable events: decrease the ultimate likelihood and impact of harm.
                                             * Unfavorable events: increase the ultimate likelihood and impact of harm.
                                             * Obligations
                                             * Favorable events: decrease the ultimate likelihood and impact of violations.
                                             * Unfavorable events: increase the ultimate likelihood and impact of violations.
The use of “ultimate” in these definitions indicates that there may be a complex chain of events that results in ultimate benefit/harm/violations.
For example, take an ambiguous event called “Senior Executive Quits.” On the surface, this event may be construed as an obstacle that would result in harm of “Lost knowledge, relationships and the potential to cascade worry into the team.” Digging into the many causes reveals hazards that are unfavorable such as “Non-competitive compensation.” Things that ought to be prevented.
However, further analysis may indicate that “Senior Executive Quits” may also provide benefits. Hiring a new person for the job from the outside provides “New ideas and relationships.” Promoting an existing team member provides career advancement opportunities and hope for others.


What appeared to be a simple and straight-forward example of something to be avoided turns into a more robust picture:  
Before
                                             * Promote/Enable
                                             * Promote executive careers beyond the organization with “job search” programs
                                             * Promote a culture where “moving on” is viewed as graduating instead of leaving
                                             *                                              * Prevent/Deter
                                             * Deter quitting by ensuring compensation plans are always within benchmarks
After
                                             * Compound/Amplify
                                             * Recognize executives and employees who recently became “alumni”
                                             * Recognize alumni for many months and years with periodic communications
                                             * Accelerate “New Ideas” by pausing existing work for 2 weeks to adjust to new situation
                                             * Correct/Recover
                                             * Attempt to retain senior executive with lateral or other opportunities
                                             * Allow team left behind to pause existing work one week to adjust to new situation
                                             * Recover from relationship loss by connecting with former executive’s key accounts
Action & Control Types
Action and control types aim to be proactive, detective and responsive to address opportunities, obstacles and obligations.
  

                                             * Proactive Actions & Controls prevent unfavorable events before they happen and promote favorable events. Proactive actions & controls include:
                                             * Prevent/Deter Actions & Controls decrease the likelihood of unfavorable events.
                                             * Promote/Enable Actions & Controls increase the likelihood of favorable events.

                                                * Detective Actions & Controls detect the occurrence of favorable and unfavorable events.

                                                * Responsive Actions & Controls compound/accelerate the benefits of favorable events and correct/recover from the harm of unfavorable events. Responsive actions & controls include:
                                                   * Compound/Accelerate Actions & Controls accelerate and compound the impact of favorable events to increase benefits and promote future occurrence. 
                                                   * Correct/Recover Actions & Controls slow down or decrease the impact of unfavorable events, and return the organization to its original state, stable state, or superior state after harm has occurred to minimize harm and prevent future occurrences.
________________
Action & Control Categories
Policy, people, process, physical, informational, technological, and financial actions & controls represent the full range of action & control categories.
                                                   * Policy – formal statements and rules about organizational intentions and expectations. 
                                                   * People – human factors, including structure, accountability, education, and enablement.
                                                   * Process - how/when to perform activities and where/who to assign accountability.
                                                   * Physical – infrastructures such as facilities and other structures.
                                                   * Information – communications up, down, and across the organization.
                                                   * Technology - hardware and software systems that facilitate other categories.
                                                   * Financial - insurance, captives, hedging, reserves, or other financial instruments.
Action & Control Techniques
Action and control techniques are within and may span multiple categories. 
For example, “segregation of duties” is a technique that spans multiple categories (and may be considered multiple controls). Segregation of duties:
                                                   * structures “people” in a way that specifies who can / cannot perform certain tasks; 
                                                   * is often articulated in a “policy” outlining roles and responsibilities; and 
                                                   * is embodied in “technology” access controls.
Action & Control Orientation
When designing actions & controls an organization should consider the governance, management, and assurance orientations.
Management actions & controls should be the primary focus when designing an approach. If, and only if, management actions & controls are insufficient for governance and assurance purposes should additional actions & controls be considered.
                                                   * Management Actions & Controls are required for management to address opportunities, obstacles, and obligations. Management actions & controls comprise most of the work performed by the organization. Whenever possible, management actions & controls should be used by both the governing authority and assurance personnel to avoid unnecessary complexity and duplication.
                                                   * Governance Actions & Controls are additional controls beyond management controls that assist the governing authority in constraining and conscribing the organization. Additional governance actions & controls are added when management actions & controls do not provide enough information or guidance to constrain and conscribe the organization.

                                                   * Assurance Actions & Controls are additional controls beyond management and governance controls that assist assurance personnel to provide assurance services. Additional assurance controls are added when management and governance actions & controls do not provide sufficient information to assurance providers.

Part II - GRC Outcomes & Capabilities
The GRC Capability Model codifies the continuously improving body of knowledge about how GRC works in an organization. It comprises four (4) components and twenty (20) elements that help an organization ask and answer key questions such as:
                                                      * LEARN - Who are we? Where are we? What might affect us? Who do we serve? How will they judge us? What is our business model?

                                                      * ALIGN - Where are we going? How will we get there? How will we address the opportunities, obstacles, and obligations along the way?

                                                      * PERFORM - How proactive are we? How do we detect problems and progress? How do we respond to favorable events and unfavorable events?

                                                      * REVIEW - Are we making progress? How confident are we? How can we improve?  
U - Universal Outcomes

L – LEARN
Examine and understand stakeholders, the external context, the internal context, and the culture of the organization to make sense of reality and changes as they unfold.
Principled Performance requires that an organization learn about and make sense of internal and external realities as it strives to meet the needs of stakeholders.
The internal context and culture describe the capabilities and resources that the organization uses to meet stakeholder needs. The external context represents the reality in which the organization operates. 
By making sense of internal realities, external realities, culture, and stakeholders, the organization can shape the most appropriate direction, objectives, and approach to achieve Principled Performance.

LEARN Component Considerations
                                                         * Learning about internal and external realities is a “sensemaking” process that aims to understand reality so the organization can act.
                                                         * External context, internal context, culture, and stakeholders are interrelated elements without clear boundaries. The most important outcome is an understanding of the internal and external factors and how these realities impact the organization.
                                                         * External context and stakeholder needs are outside the organization’s direct control. Strive to influence and shape these external realities over time. 
                                                         * Internal context and culture are, at least theoretically, under an organization's direct control. Still, these internal realities require long-term planning to influence and shape.
                                                         * Context, culture, and stakeholders are defined relative to the organization in scope. For example, if the organization in scope is a single team, then the “external context” would include all aspects outside of the team.
                                                         * Even if the organization in scope is a subordinate unit (business units, departments, and teams), it is important to understand the realities at the highest organizational unit (the enterprise) as these realities cascade to subordinate organizational units.
                                                         * Changes in context should be sensed and analyzed to determine why, what, when, and how to change the organization.
                                                         * It is crucial to understand what changes are important and which are mere distractions.
LEARN Component Measurement
                                                         * Effective. Do we have the capability to LEARN? Do we have the capability to understand internal and external contexts? Do we have the capability to understand culture? Do we have the capability to understand stakeholders? Do these capabilities operate as designed?
                                                         * Efficient. How efficient is our use of capital to LEARN? How efficient is our use of financial capital? Physical capital? Human capital? Information capital?
                                                         * Agile. When things change, how quickly do we RE-LEARN the context and culture?
                                                         * Resilient. Do we have appropriate depth and coverage to withstand stress? After stress, are we more capable or less capable to LEARN?

Do we have the capability to identify and analyze opportunities, obstacles, and obligations? Do we have the capability to design our organization? Do these capabilities operate as designed?
                                                               * Efficient. How efficient is our use of capital for ALIGN? How efficient is our use of financial capital? Physical capital? Human capital? Information capital?
                                                               * Agile. When things change, how quickly do we RE-ALIGN? How quickly do we change or refine direction and objectives? How quickly do we respond to new opportunities, obstacles, and obligations? 
                                                               * Resilient. Do we have appropriate depth and coverage to withstand stress? After stress, are we more capable or less capable to ALIGN?

                                                                                 * High-level design options to accept, avoid, and share may obviate the need for detailed design. The choice to control tends to require more detailed planning.
                                                                                 * Using a mix of actions & control types, action & control categories are important to address all action & control orientations.
                                                                                 * Use consistent definitions and terms whenever possible, or invest in a method to translate meaning across departments and disciplines to avoid misunderstandings.
                                                                                 * Not every cost and not every benefit can be quantified with precision – when using quantitative methods, choose a degree of confidence (e.g., 50%, 75%, 90%, 95%, 99%) as appropriate.
                                                                                 * Avoid selecting technologies in advance of thoroughly assessing needs and taking inventory of current approaches. Use existing investments whenever possible and adequate.
                                                                                 * When allocating actions & controls across lines of accountability, ensure that the right levels of objectivity and competence are available.
                                                                                 * Identify actions & controls that specifically address areas with high levels of inherent risk that, should the actions & controls cease to perform effectively, would expose the organization to unacceptable, existential consequences.

P – PERFORM
Address opportunities, obstacles, and obligations by performing proactive, detective, and responsive actions & controls to serve governance, management, and assurance needs.
Principled Performance requires that organizations address opportunities, obstacles, and obligations using a mix of actions & controls. Actions & controls are organized by type, category, and orientation.
Action & control types include proactive, detective, and responsive controls. These types use techniques from categories such as policy, people, process, physical, technology, and information. Regardless of type or technique, every action & control aims to serve a management, governance, or assurance orientation.

                                                                                 * Action & Control types include proactive, detective, and responsive actions & controls. Proactive actions & controls promote favorable events and prevent unfavorable events. Detective actions & controls detect favorable and unfavorable events as soon as possible. Responsive controls compound the effect of favorable events and correct/recover from unfavorable events.
                                                                                 * Action & Control orientation includes management, governance, and assurance actions & controls. Management actions & controls comprise the majority of work performed by the organization. Additional governance actions & controls are added when management actions & controls do not provide enough information or guidance to constrain and conscribe the organization. Additional assurance controls are added when management and governance actions & controls do not provide sufficient value to assurance providers.
                                                                                 * Action & Control categories include policy, people, process, physical, technology, and information. Some techniques may span categories. For example, “segregation of duties” is a “people-oriented control” that is often articulated in a “policy” and embodied in “technology-oriented access controls.”

                                                                                 * Efficient. How efficient is our use of capital to PERFORM? How efficient is our use of financial capital? Physical capital? Human capital? Information capital?
                                                                                 * Agile. When things change, how quickly do we change direction in PERFORM? 
                                                                                 * Resilient. Do we have appropriate depth and coverage to withstand stress? After stress, are we more capable or less capable to PERFORM?

This means that information does not flow to superior units.
                                                                                          * Information overload may occur if communication is delivered too rapidly or voluminously.

Educational Models may also be used to implement educational plans. Learning activities between instructors and students are based on structured learning content that aims at achieving learning objectives and learning outcomes; mainly to fill the skill gap between the current skill level and the target skill level.
                                                                                             * Implementing integrated support or a helpline post-education is highly advised. As it allows learners to seek professional advice and receive it in a timely manner and ultimately increase the level of performance.
                                                                                             * Education and support should address all levels of the organization.

Continuously improve total performance by monitoring actions & controls – and providing assurance about priority objectives, opportunities, obstacles, and obligations.
Principled Performance requires that organizations monitor actions & controls, provide assurance about priority areas, and continuously improve total performance to be effective, efficient, responsive, and resilient in all areas.
Monitoring helps management and the governing authority understand progress toward objectives and whether opportunities, obstacles, and obligations are addressed. Assurance activities objectively and competently evaluate the organization to provide justified conclusions and confidence about total performance.
Both monitoring and assurance activities identify opportunities to improve total performance so that the capability and organization are more effective, efficient, responsive, and resilient.

For example, an organization makes an implicit promise to every employee that they will be gainfully employed so long as the employee adds value. However, external factors, such as an economic downturn, might prevent the organization from honoring the employment promise, even if the employee is adding value. To maintain integrity, then, an organization must do its best to help the employee find gainful employment.

ADDIE Model
ADDIE is a systematic instructional design model used by instructional designers to develop effective training programs and instructional materials. The ADDIE model consists of five phases: Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation.
                                                                                                         * Analysis: The first phase involves analyzing the training needs of the learners and the learning context. This includes identifying the learning objectives, analyzing the target audience, and evaluating the existing resources and constraints.
                                                                                                         * Design: The second phase involves designing the learning materials and instructional strategies based on the results of the analysis phase. This includes developing a course outline, designing learning activities, and creating assessments.
                                                                                                         * Development: The third phase involves developing the learning materials and resources based on the design phase. This includes creating the learning materials, developing multimedia resources, and creating assessments.
                                                                                                         * Implementation: The fourth phase involves implementing the learning program in the actual learning environment. This includes training instructors and learners, delivering the learning materials, and providing technical support.
                                                                                                         * Evaluation: The final phase involves evaluating the effectiveness of the learning program. This includes collecting and analyzing data on learner outcomes, assessing the effectiveness of the instructional design, and identifying opportunities for improvement.
The ADDIE model provides a structured approach to instructional design, helping instructional designers to create effective and engaging learning experiences that meet the needs of learners and achieve desired learning outcomes.
After Action Review (AAR)
fter Action Reviews (AAR) is a process used by organizations to evaluate and analyze the results of a specific project, event, or operation. The purpose of AAR is to identify what went well, what did not go well, and what can be improved in the future.
AAR typically involves the following steps:
                                                                                                         * Planning: This involves defining the objectives and scope of the AAR, identifying the participants, and selecting the facilitator.
                                                                                                         * Conducting the AAR: This involves gathering feedback from participants about what went well, what did not go well, and what can be improved in the future. The feedback is typically structured around a series of questions and is facilitated by a trained facilitator.
                                                                                                         * Analyzing the feedback: This involves analyzing the feedback gathered during the AAR to identify patterns and trends, and to identify specific areas for improvement.
                                                                                                         * Developing an action plan: This involves developing an action plan based on the feedback gathered during the AAR, including specific actions that can be taken to improve performance in the future.
                                                                                                         * Implementing the action plan: This involves implementing the actions identified in the action plan, and monitoring progress to ensure that improvements are being made.
After Action Reviews can help organizations to learn from their experiences and improve their performance in the future. By identifying what went well and what did not go well, organizations can develop strategies to build on their successes and address areas of weakness. The process of conducting AAR can also help to promote a culture of continuous improvement and learning within the organization.
Application Performance Monitoring
Application Performance Monitoring (APM) with automated alerts is a process of monitoring and analyzing the performance of an application to ensure that it meets the required service level objectives (SLOs). APM with automated alerts typically involves using software tools to collect data on the application's performance and generating automated alerts when performance falls below certain thresholds or when there are other anomalies.
Balanced Scorecard
The Balanced Scorecard is a strategic management framework that is used to align an organization's strategy and objectives with its key performance indicators (KPIs) and measures. The framework was first introduced by Drs. Robert Kaplan and David Norton in the 1990s.
The Balanced Scorecard typically includes four perspectives: financial, customer, internal processes, and learning and growth. Each perspective has a set of measures that are used to track and evaluate performance. By using a Balanced Scorecard, organizations can ensure that their strategy and objectives are aligned with their operations, and can monitor progress towards their goals.
The framework is designed to provide a comprehensive view of an organization's performance and progress, and to balance short-term and long-term goals, financial and non-financial goals, and objectives related to customers, internal processes, and learning and growth. The Balanced Scorecard is often used to drive innovation, increase accountability, and improve performance in organizations.
The Balanced Scorecard can be customized and tailored to the specific needs and objectives of an organization, and is often used in conjunction with other strategic management frameworks and tools. It provides a structured approach to strategic planning and performance management, and helps organizations to ensure that their strategy and objectives are aligned with their overall mission and vision.
Bayesian Analysis
Bayesian analysis is a statistical approach used to update the probability of a hypothesis or model based on new data or evidence. The Bayesian approach involves the use of Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula used to calculate the probability of a hypothesis given new data or evidence.
The Bayesian approach differs from classical statistical approaches in that it incorporates prior knowledge and beliefs about the hypothesis or model being tested. Prior knowledge can be based on previous data or research, expert opinion, or other sources of information. This prior knowledge is represented in the Bayesian analysis as a prior probability distribution, which is then updated based on the new data or evidence to produce a posterior probability distribution.
The posterior probability distribution provides an estimate of the probability of the hypothesis or model given the new data or evidence. This estimate is based on the combination of the prior knowledge and the new data or evidence, and is updated as new data or evidence becomes available.
Bayesian analysis is particularly useful in situations where there is limited data available or where prior knowledge can provide useful insights into the problem being studied.
Behavioral Economics
Behavioral economics is a branch of economics that combines insights from psychology, sociology, and neuroscience to understand how people make economic decisions. Traditional economics assumes that people are rational actors who always make decisions that are in their best interest. In contrast, behavioral economics recognizes that people are influenced by cognitive biases, emotions, social norms, and other factors that can affect their decision-making.
Behavioral economics explores how people make decisions in a variety of contexts, such as savings, investment, consumption, and labor markets. Some of the key concepts in behavioral economics include:
                                                                                                         * Loss aversion: People tend to be more sensitive to losses than gains, and may make decisions to avoid losses even if the potential gains are greater.
                                                                                                         * Confirmation bias: People tend to seek out and interpret information in a way that confirms their pre-existing beliefs and values.
                                                                                                         * Framing effects: The way a decision is framed or presented can influence the choices people make.
                                                                                                         * Social norms: People are influenced by the norms and expectations of the groups and communities they belong to.
Behavioral economics has important implications for policy-makers and organizations, as it can help to design interventions that nudge people towards making better decisions. For example, employers can use behavioral economics principles to design workplace savings programs that encourage employees to save more, or governments can use behavioral economics principles to design tax policies that encourage environmentally-friendly behavior.
Behavioral Psychology
Behavioral psychology is a branch of psychology that focuses on understanding human behavior through observable actions and responses to environmental stimuli. It is also known as behaviorism. Behavioral psychologists believe that behavior is shaped by environmental factors, rather than internal thoughts or emotions.
Some of the key concepts in behavioral psychology include:
                                                                                                         * Classical conditioning: A process by which a neutral stimulus comes to evoke a particular response after being paired with a stimulus that already produces that response.
                                                                                                         * Operant conditioning: A process by which behavior is modified through reinforcement and punishment. Behaviors that are reinforced (rewarded) tend to be repeated, while behaviors that are punished tend to be avoided.
                                                                                                         * Observational learning: A process by which individuals learn by observing the behavior of others and the consequences that result from that behavior.
Bloom’s Taxonomy
Bloom's Taxonomy is a framework for categorizing educational goals and objectives. The framework was developed in 1956 by educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom and his colleagues, and it has become widely used in education and instructional design. The taxonomy identifies three domains: 
                                                                                                         * Affective Skills - focuses on emotion
                                                                                                         * Psychomotor Skills - focuses on physical actions
                                                                                                         * Cognitive Domain - focuses on thoughts and knowledge
The Cognitive Domain is most often used in educational activities and was revised in 2001 by experts Anderson and Krathwohl. It consists of six levels of learning, each of which represents a different type of cognitive skill or ability. The six levels are:
                                                                                                         * Level 1 - Remembering: Recognizing or recalling knowledge from memory. Remembering is when memory is used to produce or retrieve definitions, facts, or lists, or to recite previously learned information.
                                                                                                         * Level 2 - Understanding: Constructing meaning from different types of functions, be they written or graphic messages or activities like interpreting, exemplifying, classifying, summarizing, inferring, comparing, or explaining.
                                                                                                         * Level 3 - Applying: Carrying out or using a procedure through executing or implementing. Applying relates to or refers to situations where learned material is used through products like models, presentations, interviews, or simulations. 
                                                                                                         * Level 4 - Analyzing: Breaking materials or concepts into parts, determining how the parts relate to one another or how they interrelate, or how the parts relate to an overall structure or purpose. Mental actions included in this function are differentiating, organizing, and attributing, as well as being able to distinguish between the components or parts. When one is analyzing, he/she can illustrate this mental function by creating spreadsheets, surveys, charts, or diagrams, or graphic representations.
                                                                                                         * Level 5 - Evaluating: Making judgments based on criteria and standards through checking and critiquing. Critiques, recommendations, and reports are some of the products that can be created to demonstrate the processes of evaluation. Evaluating comes before creating, as it is often a necessary part of the precursory behavior before one creates something. 
                                                                                                         * Level 6 - Creating: Putting elements together to form a coherent or functional whole; reorganizing elements into a new pattern or structure through generating, planning, or producing. Creating requires users to put parts together in a new way or synthesize parts into something new and different, creating a new form or product. This process is the most difficult mental function.
Bowtie Diagram
A bowtie diagram is a tool used in risk management and safety engineering to visualize and assess the potential causes and consequences of a hazardous event or scenario. The bowtie diagram is so named because it resembles a bowtie, with the event or scenario represented as the knot of the bowtie and the potential causes and consequences represented as the left and right sides of the bowtie, respectively.
The bowtie diagram is a useful tool because it provides a visual representation of the relationship between the causes and consequences of a hazardous event, and helps to identify and prioritize potential preventive and mitigative measures to reduce the risk of the event occurring.
The bowtie diagram typically starts with the identification of the hazardous event or scenario at the knot of the bowtie. The potential causes that could lead to the hazardous event are identified and listed on the left side of the bowtie, while the potential consequences of the hazardous event are listed on the right side of the bowtie.
Business Continuity Planning (BCP)
Business Continuity Planning (BCP) is a process of identifying and managing the risks that could disrupt or harm an organization's operations. BCP involves developing a comprehensive plan that outlines how the organization will continue to operate in the event of a disruptive event, such as a natural disaster, cyber attack, or other unforeseen crisis.
The main objectives of BCP are to:
                                                                                                         * Identify the critical business processes and resources required for the organization to continue operating during and after a disruptive event.
                                                                                                         * Develop and implement plans to ensure the organization can continue to operate and deliver essential products and services during and after a disruptive event.
                                                                                                         * Test and validate the effectiveness of the BCP plan through regular exercises and drills.
BCP typically involves the following steps:
                                                                                                         1. Risk assessment: Identify the potential threats and risks that could disrupt the organization's operations, such as natural disasters, cyber attacks, or other unforeseen events.
                                                                                                         2. Business impact analysis: Evaluate the potential impact of these threats on the organization's operations, including the critical business processes, systems, and resources required to deliver essential products and services.
                                                                                                         3. Business continuity plan development: Develop a comprehensive plan that outlines the steps the organization will take to ensure it can continue to operate during and after a disruptive event.
                                                                                                         4. Plan testing and maintenance: Regularly test and maintain the BCP plan to ensure it remains effective and up-to-date.
Business Model Canvas
The Business Model Canvas (BMC) is a strategic management tool used to visualize and develop new or existing business models. It is a one-page template that provides a visual representation of the key elements of a business, including its value proposition, customer segments, channels, customer relationships, revenue streams, key resources, key activities, key partnerships, and cost structure.
The Business Model Canvas is designed to help entrepreneurs and business leaders to quickly and easily develop and communicate their business models, as well as to identify potential opportunities and risks. It provides a clear and concise overview of the key elements of a business, and allows for easy iteration and refinement as the business evolves.
The nine elements of the Business Model Canvas are:
                                                                                                         1. Value Proposition: The product or service that the business offers to customers.
                                                                                                         2. Customer Segments: The specific groups of customers that the business is targeting.
                                                                                                         3. Channels: The methods by which the business reaches and interacts with its customers.
                                                                                                         4. Customer Relationships: The types of relationships the business has with its customers.
                                                                                                         5. Revenue Streams: The ways in which the business generates revenue.
                                                                                                         6. Key Resources: The assets and resources that the business needs to operate.

                                                                                                         8. Key Partnerships: The relationships with other businesses or entities that the business relies on to operate.
                                                                                                         9. Cost Structure: The costs associated with running the business.
By filling out the Business Model Canvas, entrepreneurs and business leaders can gain a better understanding of the key elements of their business, and can identify areas for improvement, innovation, or growth.
Causal Mapping & Cross Impact Analysis
Causal mapping and cross-impact analysis are two techniques used in strategic planning and decision-making to understand and analyze complex systems and relationships between variables.
Causal mapping is a method used to identify and analyze the causal relationships between different factors that affect a system or problem. The process involves creating a visual map or diagram that shows the cause-and-effect relationships between different variables. The causal map can be developed through brainstorming, expert opinions, or statistical analysis. Causal mapping is useful in understanding the complexity of a system and identifying the root causes of problems, which can be used to develop strategies to improve the system.
Cross-impact analysis, on the other hand, is a technique used to analyze the interdependencies and feedback loops between different factors or variables that affect a system. Cross-impact analysis involves evaluating the impact of each variable on all the other variables in the system, and the feedback loops that result from these interactions. This technique helps to identify the potential consequences and unintended effects of different decisions or strategies on the system as a whole.
Cross-impact analysis is often used in scenario planning and risk management, where it is important to understand the potential impacts of different events or decisions on a system. The process involves developing a matrix that shows the probabilities of different events occurring and the impact of these events on the different variables in the system. The matrix can be used to identify potential risks and develop strategies to mitigate these risks.
Both causal mapping and cross-impact analysis are useful techniques for understanding the complexity of a system and analyzing the relationships between different variables. These techniques can help organizations to make informed decisions and develop effective strategies to improve the performance of their systems.
Communication Strategy Framework
Michael and Sandra Rouse developed the Communication Strategy Framework and published it in their 2001 book, "Business Communications: A Cultural and Strategic Approach." The framework guides you through planning and organizing your messages to avoid communication barriers, increase understanding, and get the response you want from your audience. The Communication Strategy Framework consists of four elements that you should consider as you organize and craft your message:
                                                                                                         * Communicator strategy.
                                                                                                         * Audience strategy.
                                                                                                         * Channel strategy.
                                                                                                         * Message strategy.
The framework may be used to plan various communications, such as phone calls, reports, emails, and presentations.
                                                                                                         * COMMUNICATOR – the sender of a message should consider questions such as:
                                                                                                         * Why are you communicating this message?
                                                                                                         * What results do you want to achieve?
                                                                                                         * What is your reputation with your audience members?
                                                                                                         * Do you share the same culture and background as your audience?

                                                                                                            * AUDIENCE – Consider audience wants, needs, education, and skill levels to craft a message that matches their interests, expectations, and understanding by answering questions such as;
                                                                                                            * Who is your audience?
                                                                                                            * Are there identifiable sub-groups within it with differing needs?
                                                                                                            * What do you know about this person or group? 
                                                                                                            * What do they know about you?
                                                                                                            * What do they know about this subject?

                                                                                                               * MESSAGE – Consider the style, tone, and structure of the message by answering questions such as:
                                                                                                               * Is your purpose to persuade, entertain, consult, or inform? 
                                                                                                               * What style and tone will best fit your purpose?
                                                                                                               * Does your message need to be formal, informal, or a subtle mix?
                                                                                                               * Does your audience already agree with this message? What will be their likely reaction?
        
                                                                                                                  * CHANNEL – Consider the most effective channel for communication by answering questions such as:
                                                                                                                  * What channel is most appropriate to use for your audience and message?
                                                                                                                  * Do you need to have a record of this communication? (If so, an email can be better than a phone call.)
                                                                                                                  * Is cost or time a consideration?
                                                                                                                  * Is culture a factor in this situation? Remember that people in some cultures prefer face-to-face communication, while others will favor using email.
When using the framework to plan communications, consider the Intention (Call to Action) behind the communication and the Cadence of regular/periodic communication, analyze the audience reaction and Feedback, and handle any Noise that may hinder communication.
Competing Values Framework
The Competing Values Framework (CVF) is a tool used to analyze and understand organizational culture. Developed by Cameron and Quinn in the 1980s, the CVF identifies four cultural types that represent the competing values in organizations:


                                                                                                                  1. Clan culture: A collaborative and team-oriented culture that emphasizes participation, employee engagement, and communication.
                                                                                                                  2. Adhocracy culture: An innovative and entrepreneurial culture that emphasizes creativity, risk-taking, and innovation.
                                                                                                                  3. Market culture: A competitive and results-oriented culture that emphasizes achieving goals, customer satisfaction, and market share.
                                                                                                                  4. Hierarchy culture: A structured and formal culture that emphasizes stability, control, and efficiency.
The CVF suggests that these four cultural types are not mutually exclusive, and that organizations may have elements of each culture. However, one cultural type is often dominant and can have a significant impact on an organization's values, beliefs, and behavior.
The CVF can be used to diagnose an organization's culture, understand its strengths and weaknesses, and identify areas for improvement. By understanding an organization's dominant cultural type, leaders can develop strategies to align their values and behaviors with the organization's goals and mission. The CVF is a useful tool for organizations looking to develop a strong culture that supports their strategic objectives.
Continuous Controls Monitoring (CCM)
Continuous Control Monitoring (CCM) is a process used by organizations to monitor their internal controls on a continuous basis. CCM systems use technology to automatically monitor and analyze data from various sources, such as financial systems, inventory systems, and other operational systems. The purpose of CCM is to identify potential control deficiencies or weaknesses in real-time, allowing organizations to take corrective action quickly and prevent fraud, errors, or other compliance issues.
COSO Internal Control - Integrated Framework
The COSO Internal Control - Integrated Framework is a widely recognized framework for designing, implementing, and assessing internal control in organizations. COSO (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission) is a joint initiative of five professional accounting and finance organizations, and the framework is one of its key contributions to the field of internal control and risk management.
The framework provides a structured and comprehensive approach to internal control, focusing on five components: control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring activities. The framework emphasizes the importance of a strong control environment, risk assessment, and control activities, and provides guidance on how to design and implement effective controls in these areas.
Continuous Process Improvement
Continuous Process Improvement (CPI) is a management approach that focuses on improving organizational processes and systems on an ongoing basis, rather than just making occasional changes or adjustments. CPI is a key component of quality management and involves identifying, analyzing, and improving processes and systems to achieve better results.
CPI typically involves the following steps:
                                                                                                                  * Identify processes: This involves identifying the key processes within the organization that need improvement, and understanding how they currently operate.
                                                                                                                  * Analyze processes: This involves analyzing the processes to identify potential improvements, such as eliminating non-value-added activities, reducing cycle time, or improving quality.
                                                                                                                  * Design improvements: This involves designing improvements to the processes, such as redesigning workflows, implementing new technologies, or changing policies and procedures.
                                                                                                                  * Implement improvements: This involves implementing the improvements, and monitoring the impact of the changes.
                                                                                                                  * Monitor and control: This involves monitoring the processes on an ongoing basis to ensure that they are operating effectively and efficiently, and making further improvements as necessary.
CPI is a continuous cycle of improvement, and is an ongoing process that requires commitment from all levels of the organization. By continuously improving processes and systems, organizations can improve their overall performance, reduce costs, and enhance customer satisfaction. CPI is also important for maintaining a culture of continuous improvement and innovation within the organization.
Culture Map
A culture map is a visual representation or framework used to help individuals or organizations understand the cultural differences and similarities between different regions, countries, or groups of people. Culture maps are designed to provide insights into the values, beliefs, behaviors, and communication styles of different cultures, and to help individuals and organizations navigate and adapt to cultural differences.
Culture maps typically present information in a visually appealing and user-friendly format, often using colors, symbols, and other graphic elements to highlight key cultural dimensions such as individualism-collectivism, power distance, uncertainty avoidance, and communication style. Culture maps may also include additional information such as cultural norms, taboos, and social practices, as well as practical tips for interacting with people from different cultures.
Culture maps can be useful tools for individuals and organizations operating in global or multicultural contexts, as they can help to identify potential cultural barriers and facilitate cross-cultural communication and collaboration. However, it's important to note that culture maps are not a substitute for in-depth knowledge and understanding of different cultures, and should be used in conjunction with other sources of information and cultural training.
Denison Organizational Culture Model
The Denison Organizational Culture Model is a framework used to assess and improve organizational culture. Developed by Daniel Denison, the model identifies four cultural traits that influence an organization's effectiveness:
                                                                                                                  * Mission: The degree to which employees understand and are committed to the organization's mission and purpose.
                                                                                                                  * Adaptability: The degree to which an organization can respond to changing internal and external environments.
                                                                                                                  * Involvement: The degree to which employees are engaged and involved in the organization's decision-making and problem-solving processes.
                                                                                                                  * Consistency: The degree to which an organization's systems and processes are aligned and integrated to achieve its goals.
The model also identifies twelve cultural dimensions, which are grouped into these four categories. The cultural dimensions include things like customer orientation, teamwork, empowerment, and performance focus.
The Denison Organizational Culture Model can be used to diagnose an organization's culture and identify areas for improvement. By assessing an organization's cultural strengths and weaknesses, leaders can develop strategies to align their values and behaviors with the organization's goals and mission. The model is useful for organizations looking to build a strong, effective culture that supports their strategic objectives.
Design Thinking
Design Thinking is a human-centered, iterative problem-solving approach used to create innovative solutions in various fields, such as product design, service design, and business strategy. It emphasizes empathy, experimentation, and collaboration, helping organizations better understand and address users' needs, preferences, and pain points.
The Design Thinking process typically consists of five stages:
                                                                                                                  1. Empathize: In this stage, the goal is to gain a deep understanding of the users or customers by observing, engaging, and empathizing with their needs, emotions, and experiences. This understanding helps teams develop insights into users' problems and challenges.
                                                                                                                  2. Define: Based on the insights gained during the empathy phase, the team articulates a clear and concise problem statement or user need. This statement serves as a focal point for the subsequent stages of the Design Thinking process.
                                                                                                                  3. Ideate: The ideation phase involves generating a wide range of potential solutions to address the defined problem or user need. It encourages creativity, open-mindedness, and divergent thinking, allowing the team to explore various ideas without restrictions or judgment.
                                                                                                                  4. Prototype: In this stage, the team creates physical or digital prototypes of the most promising ideas from the ideation phase. Prototypes can be low-fidelity, rough versions of the final solution, which help the team visualize, test, and refine their ideas before investing significant time and resources into development.
                                                                                                                  5. Test: The final stage involves testing the prototypes with real users to gather feedback, validate assumptions, and uncover any issues or improvements. The team iterates on the prototypes based on the feedback, refining and adjusting the solution until it meets users' needs effectively.
Design Thinking encourages interdisciplinary collaboration, fostering a culture of innovation and adaptability. It helps organizations create more user-centric products and services, improving customer satisfaction and achieving a competitive advantage in the market.
Divergent & Convergent Thinking
Divergent thinking and convergent thinking are two different approaches to problem solving and idea generation.
                                                                                                                  * Divergent thinking is a process of generating many different ideas or possible solutions to a problem. It involves exploring various possibilities and brainstorming a wide range of options without necessarily evaluating or judging them. The goal of divergent thinking is to generate as many ideas as possible, often through techniques like brainstorming, mind mapping, or free writing.
                                                                                                                  * Convergent thinking, on the other hand, is a process of evaluating and selecting the best idea or solution from among a set of options. It involves analyzing, comparing, and synthesizing information to arrive at a single best solution or answer. The goal of convergent thinking is to narrow down the options to the best one, often through techniques like decision-making grids or cost-benefit analysis.
Both divergent and convergent thinking are important in problem solving and decision making, and they can be used in different ways depending on the situation. Divergent thinking is often used in the early stages of problem solving, to generate a wide range of ideas and possibilities. Convergent thinking is used in the later stages of problem solving, to evaluate and select the best solution from among the options generated by divergent thinking.
Enterprise Architecture
Enterprise Architecture (EA) is a strategic planning and management framework that helps organizations align their business objectives, IT infrastructure, and technology investments. It involves the design and documentation of the structure, processes, systems, and data of an organization, in order to facilitate alignment with its overall strategy and goals.
EA provides a comprehensive view of an organization's current and future states, identifying key business and IT requirements, capabilities, and risks. It enables the development of a roadmap for change, providing a clear vision for the organization's future state and the steps required to get there.
EA is typically broken down into four domains:
                                                                                                                  1. Business Architecture: Describes the business goals, strategies, and processes that the organization needs to support its overall strategy.
                                                                                                                  2. Application Architecture: Describes the applications and information systems required to support the organization's business processes.
                                                                                                                  3. Data Architecture: Describes the organization's data architecture and the management of its data assets.
                                                                                                                  4. Technology Architecture: Describes the technical infrastructure, platforms, and networks required to support the organization's business and IT requirements.
EA is an important tool for large and complex organizations, helping to ensure that business and IT strategies are aligned and that IT investments are maximized. By providing a clear and comprehensive view of an organization's current and future states, EA enables organizations to make informed decisions about technology investments, process improvement, and business transformation.
Ethnography
Ethnography is a research method used in social sciences and anthropology to study and describe the culture, behavior, and practices of a particular group of people or community. The goal of ethnography is to gain an in-depth understanding of the way of life, beliefs, values, and social structures of the group being studied.
Ethnographers typically use a variety of methods to collect data, including participant observation, interviews, and document analysis. They spend an extended period of time in the community they are studying to develop a rapport with its members and gain a holistic understanding of their way of life.
Ethnography can be conducted in a range of settings, from small communities and subcultures to large organizations and nations. Ethnographic research can be applied in various fields, such as marketing, education, healthcare, and policy-making, to gain insights into the needs and perspectives of different groups.
Event Tree Analysis (ETA) & Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)
vent Tree Analysis (ETA) and Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) are two methods used in risk analysis and safety engineering to evaluate and analyze the causes and consequences of potential hazardous events.
Event Tree Analysis (ETA) is a top-down approach that starts with a specific initiating event and then identifies all the possible outcomes and consequences that could occur as a result of that event. ETA is typically used to analyze complex systems with many potential outcomes and to evaluate the effectiveness of different response options.
The ETA process involves several steps, including:
                                                                                                                  * Identify the initiating event or hazard.
                                                                                                                  * Develop a tree diagram that shows all the possible outcomes and consequences that could occur.
                                                                                                                  * Assign probabilities to each outcome and consequence based on their likelihood of occurring.
                                                                                                                  * Calculate the overall probability of each outcome or consequence.
                                                                                                                  * Evaluate the effectiveness of different response options and identify ways to reduce the risk of potential hazardous events.
Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), on the other hand, is a bottom-up approach that starts with a specific hazard or failure mode and then identifies all the possible causes and contributing factors that could lead to that hazard or failure. FTA is typically used to evaluate the safety and reliability of complex systems and to identify ways to prevent or mitigate potential hazards.
The FTA process involves several steps, including:
                                                                                                                  * Identify the specific hazard or failure mode.
                                                                                                                  * Develop a tree diagram that shows all the possible causes and contributing factors that could lead to that hazard or failure.
                                                                                                                  * Assign probabilities to each cause and contributing factor based on their likelihood of occurring.
                                                                                                                  * Calculate the overall probability of the hazard or failure occurring.
                                                                                                                  * Identify ways to prevent or mitigate the hazard or failure by adding or improving safety features or procedures.
Both ETA and FTA are useful tools for analyzing and evaluating the risks associated with complex systems and identifying ways to prevent or mitigate potential hazards. They are widely used in industries such as aviation, nuclear power, chemical, and oil and gas, where safety and reliability are critical.
Exit Interview
Exit interviews are a process used by organizations to gather feedback from employees who are leaving the organization voluntarily or involuntarily. The purpose of exit interviews is to identify the reasons why employees are leaving the organization, and to gather feedback on their experiences working for the organization.
Exit interviews are typically conducted by a member of the human resources (HR) team or an external consultant, and can be conducted in-person, over the phone, or through an online survey. The interviewer asks the departing employee questions about their reasons for leaving, their experiences working for the organization, and any suggestions they have for improving the organization.
Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)
FMEA (Failure Modes and Effects Analysis) is a systematic approach to identifying and evaluating potential failures or problems in a product or process. It is a technique used in quality management and risk assessment to minimize the risk of product or process failures, improve product or process reliability, and reduce costs associated with corrective actions.
The FMEA process typically involves the following steps:
                                                                                                                  1. Selection of the product or process to be analyzed
                                                                                                                  2. Formation of a cross-functional team consisting of experts in the product or process
                                                                                                                  3. Identification of potential failure modes and their effects on the product or process
                                                                                                                  4. Assessment of the potential severity, occurrence, and detectability of each failure mode
                                                                                                                  5. Calculation of a risk priority number (RPN) for each failure mode, which is a product of the severity, occurrence, and detectability ratings
                                                                                                                  6. Development of recommendations to mitigate or eliminate the highest risk failure modes
                                                                                                                  7. Implementation of corrective actions and monitoring of their effectiveness.
The FMEA technique is widely used in various industries, including automotive, aerospace, electronics, and healthcare, among others. It is an effective method to identify potential failures and improve product or process reliability. By conducting an FMEA analysis, organizations can identify potential failure modes, evaluate their impact, and develop strategies to prevent or mitigate them, which can help minimize the risk of product or process failures, improve quality, and reduce costs associated with corrective actions.
Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR)
Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) is a quantitative framework used to assess and analyze information security risk. FAIR is a methodology that provides a standardized approach for identifying, analyzing, and quantifying different types of information security risks in a consistent and repeatable way.
FAIR is based on the premise that risk can be expressed as a function of the likelihood of an event occurring and the impact or consequences of that event. The framework identifies different factors that contribute to information security risk, such as threats, vulnerabilities, assets, and controls, and analyzes these factors to determine the level of risk.
FAIR involves several steps, including:
                                                                                                                  * Identify assets: Identify the information assets that are being protected.
                                                                                                                  * Identify threats: Identify the potential threats that could impact the information assets.
                                                                                                                  * Identify vulnerabilities: Identify the vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the systems or processes that could be exploited by the threats.
                                                                                                                  * Assess impact: Determine the potential impact or consequences of a security breach on the information assets.
                                                                                                                  * Assess likelihood: Determine the likelihood of a security breach occurring, taking into account the threat actors, their motivations, and the vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
                                                                                                                  * Determine risk: Calculate the level of risk by combining the likelihood and impact of a security breach.
Hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP)
Hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) is a systematic approach to identify and control potential hazards throughout a production process. Though it originated in food safety, the principles may be used in other contexts.
HACCP focuses on identifying and preventing hazards before they can cause harm to consumers.
The HACCP system involves seven principles that are applied throughout the food production process. These principles are:
                                                                                                                  1. Conduct a hazard analysis: Identify and evaluate potential biological, chemical, and physical hazards associated with each step of the food production process.
                                                                                                                  2. Identify critical control points (CCPs): Determine the points in the food production process where hazards can be controlled or eliminated.
                                                                                                                  3. Establish critical limits: Set limits for each CCP that must be met to ensure food safety.
                                                                                                                  4. Establish monitoring procedures: Develop procedures to monitor the CCPs and ensure that critical limits are being met.
                                                                                                                  5. Establish corrective actions: Develop procedures to take corrective action if critical limits are not being met.
                                                                                                                  6. Establish verification procedures: Develop procedures to verify that the HACCP system is working effectively.
                                                                                                                  7. Establish record-keeping and documentation procedures: Keep records of all aspects of the HACCP system, including the hazard analysis, CCPs, critical limits, monitoring procedures, corrective actions, and verification procedures.
HAZOP
HAZOP (Hazard and Operability) is a technique used in process safety management to identify potential hazards and operational problems in industrial processes and systems. It is a structured and systematic approach to identify, evaluate and control potential risks and hazards to prevent accidents, injuries, and damage to equipment and property.

The HAZOP technique is widely used in various industries including chemical, petrochemical, pharmaceuticals, oil and gas, and food processing, among others. It is a comprehensive and effective method to identify potential hazards and improve the safety and reliability of industrial processes and systems. By conducting a HAZOP analysis, organizations can identify potential hazards, evaluate their impact, and develop strategies to prevent or control them, which can help minimize the risk of accidents, injuries, and damage to equipment and property.
Hoshin Kanri
Hoshin Kanri, also known as Policy Deployment, is a management methodology that originated in Japan and is widely used in business strategy and planning. It is a systematic approach to aligning an organization's strategy with its operations and actions.
The Hoshin Kanri process involves the following steps:
                                                                                                                  1. Develop a strategic plan: Develop a clear and concise strategic plan that outlines the organization's goals, objectives, and priorities.

Hoshin Kanri has been used successfully in a variety of industries and has been adapted to suit the needs and requirements of different organizations. It is a powerful tool for organizations looking to improve their strategic planning and execution processes, and to ensure that their actions are aligned with their overall goals and objectives.
Internal Control
Internal control refers to a set of policies, procedures, and practices put in place within an organization to ensure that its operations are conducted in a reliable, efficient, and compliant manner. The purpose of internal control is to safeguard an organization's assets, prevent fraud and errors, and ensure accurate financial reporting.
According to COSO, internal control can be categorized into five components:
                                                                                                                  1. Control environment: This component refers to the overall culture, attitudes, and tone set by management regarding the importance of internal control within the organization.
                                                                                                                  2. Risk assessment: This component involves identifying the potential risks that an organization faces, such as fraud, errors, or legal compliance issues.
                                                                                                                  3. Control activities: This component involves designing and implementing systems and procedures to mitigate the identified risks, such as establishing segregation of duties, authorizations, and approvals, and implementing access controls.
                                                                                                                  4. Information and communication: This component involves ensuring that accurate, timely, and relevant information is communicated to the appropriate parties within the organization.
                                                                                                                  5. Monitoring: This component involves ongoing monitoring and review of the effectiveness of internal controls to ensure that they continue to function as intended and to identify areas for improvement.
Ishikawa (Fishbone) Diagram
The Ishikawa diagram, also known as the fishbone diagram or cause-and-effect diagram, is a tool used in quality management and problem-solving to identify the root causes of a particular problem or issue. It was developed by Dr. Kaoru Ishikawa, a Japanese quality control expert.
The fishbone diagram is called so because it resembles a fish skeleton with the problem or effect being depicted as the head of the fish and the potential causes represented by the bones of the fish.
The Ishikawa diagram is typically used in a group brainstorming session. The problem is written at the head of the diagram, and the main categories of potential causes are listed along the "bones" of the diagram. These categories could include people, processes, equipment, materials, and environment, among others. Then, the group identifies specific potential causes for each category and adds them as branches to the appropriate category.
Once all the potential causes have been identified, the group can then prioritize and focus on the most likely root causes to address the problem. By using this visual representation, the fishbone diagram helps to organize and identify the complex relationships between the potential causes of a problem and to facilitate effective problem-solving discussions.
Jobs-To-Be-Done Framework
The Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) Framework is a customer-centric innovation and marketing approach that focuses on understanding the underlying needs or "jobs" that customers are trying to accomplish when they buy or use a product or service. The main idea behind the JTBD framework is that customers don't just buy products or services; they "hire" them to get specific jobs done in their lives.
The Jobs-to-be-Done framework was developed by several innovation experts, including Clayton Christensen, Anthony Ulwick, and others. It shifts the focus from the product features or customer demographics to the actual problem the customer is trying to solve. By understanding the jobs that customers want to get done, organizations can design and develop better products, services, and experiences that effectively address those needs and create value for the customers.
The key components of the JTBD framework include:
                                                                                                                  * Jobs: These are the functional, emotional, and social tasks that customers want to accomplish, such as solving a problem, achieving a goal, or satisfying a need.
                                                                                                                  * Circumstances: The specific context or situation in which customers are trying to get their jobs done. Circumstances are critical to understanding the real motivations behind customers' choices and behaviors.
                                                                                                                  * Pain points: The difficulties, obstacles, or frustrations that customers face while trying to get their jobs done. Identifying and addressing pain points helps organizations create better solutions for their customers.
                                                                                                                  * Desired outcomes: The expected benefits or improvements that customers want to achieve by getting their jobs done. These outcomes serve as a benchmark for evaluating the success of a product or service in meeting customers' needs.
Applying the JTBD framework helps organizations develop a deeper understanding of their customers and uncover opportunities for innovation and growth. It also enables businesses to refine their marketing and sales strategies by focusing on the value they create for customers in getting their jobs done.
Kirkpatrick Model of Training Evaluation
The Kirkpatrick Model of Training Evaluation is a framework for evaluating the effectiveness of training programs. The GRC Capability Model was developed by Donald Kirkpatrick in the 1950s, and it has become widely used in the field of training and development.
The Kirkpatrick Model consists of four levels of evaluation:
                                                                                                                  * Level 1: Reaction: This level involves gathering feedback from participants about their reactions to the training program, such as their satisfaction with the program and their perceptions of its relevance and usefulness.
                                                                                                                  * Level 2: Learning: This level involves assessing the extent to which participants have acquired new knowledge, skills, and attitudes as a result of the training program.
                                                                                                                  * Level 3: Behavior: This level involves evaluating the extent to which participants are applying what they learned in the training program on the job, and whether the training is having an impact on their behavior and performance.
                                                                                                                  * Level 4: Results: This level involves measuring the impact of the training program on the organization, such as changes in productivity, quality, customer satisfaction, or profitability.
Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA)
Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA) is a risk assessment method used in process safety management to evaluate and analyze the effectiveness of multiple layers of protection against potential hazards. LOPA is a semi-quantitative approach that provides a simplified way of assessing risk by estimating the frequency and consequence of potential hazardous events.
LOPA involves identifying and analyzing the different layers of protection that are in place to prevent, detect, or mitigate potential hazards. These layers of protection can include equipment, procedures, personnel, and other measures that are designed to prevent or control hazardous events.
The LOPA process involves several steps, including:
                                                                                                                  * Hazard identification: Identify potential hazardous events and their causes.
                                                                                                                  * Consequence analysis: Determine the potential consequences of each hazardous event.
                                                                                                                  * Frequency analysis: Estimate the likelihood of each hazardous event occurring.
                                                                                                                  * Risk estimation: Calculate the risk associated with each hazardous event based on its frequency and consequences.
                                                                                                                  * Layer of protection analysis: Evaluate the effectiveness of the different layers of protection that are in place to prevent or mitigate the hazardous event.
                                                                                                                  * Risk reduction: Determine whether additional layers of protection are needed to reduce the risk associated with the hazardous event.
Management by Objectives (MBO)
Management By Objectives (MBO) was first introduced by Peter Drucker in his 1954 book "The Practice of Management." Drucker believed that management should focus on achieving specific, measurable objectives, rather than on the day-to-day activities of employees.
Drucker's MBO approach emphasized the following key principles:
                                                                                                                  * Objectives should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).
                                                                                                                  * Objectives should be aligned with the organization's strategic objectives, and should contribute to the organization's overall mission.
                                                                                                                  * Objectives should be set collaboratively between managers and employees, and should be reviewed and revised regularly.
                                                                                                                  * Progress toward achieving objectives should be monitored and evaluated regularly, and feedback should be provided to employees to support continuous improvement.
Drucker believed that MBO could help organizations to improve performance, increase employee motivation and engagement, and align individual objectives with organizational objectives. He saw MBO as a way to promote a culture of continuous improvement and learning, in which employees are encouraged to take ownership of their objectives and strive to achieve their goals.
While MBO has evolved over time and is now implemented in various forms, Drucker's original principles remain relevant today. MBO continues to be widely used as a management approach, and has been shown to be effective in improving organizational performance and employee engagement.
Management Dashboards
Management Dashboards and Business Intelligence (BI) with automated alerts are tools used by organizations to monitor and analyze their key performance indicators (KPIs), key risk indicators (KRIs) and key compliance indicators (KCIs) and make data-driven decisions. Management dashboards are visual representations of indicators, which provide a quick and easy way for managers and executives to monitor the performance of their organization. Business intelligence involves the collection, analysis, and reporting of data to support business decision-making.
Markov Analysis
Markov analysis is a mathematical method used to analyze and model systems that involve a sequence of events or transitions. The Markov analysis is based on the concept of Markov chains, which is a mathematical model that describes the probabilities of moving from one state to another in a system that changes over time.
In Markov analysis, a system is represented as a set of discrete states, and the probabilities of transitioning from one state to another are determined based on historical data or assumptions about the system. The Markov analysis uses a matrix to represent the probabilities of moving from one state to another, which is called the transition matrix.
The Markov analysis can be used to model a wide range of systems, including financial markets, supply chains, and customer behavior. It is also used in operations management to analyze the behavior of production systems, such as manufacturing processes and service delivery systems.
One of the key advantages of Markov analysis is that it can be used to predict the future behavior of a system based on its current state and historical data. This predictive capability is particularly useful in situations where it is important to plan for future events or to optimize system performance.
Markov analysis is widely used in various fields, including economics, engineering, computer science, and operations research. It is a powerful tool for analyzing complex systems and making informed decisions based on data-driven insights.
Minimax, ALARP, SFAIRP decision frameworks
Minimax, ALARP, and SFAIRP are three different decision-making frameworks used in risk management to assess the acceptability of risk and determine appropriate risk control measures.
                                                                                                                  * Minimax: The minimax framework is a decision-making approach that seeks to minimize the maximum possible loss or harm that could result from a given risk. In other words, the focus is on reducing the worst-case scenario. This framework is often used in situations where the consequences of a risk are severe, but the likelihood of the risk occurring is low.
                                                                                                                  * ALARP: The ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable) framework is a decision-making approach that seeks to reduce risk to a level that is as low as reasonably practicable, taking into account both the likelihood and the consequences of the risk. This framework recognizes that it may not be possible or practical to eliminate all risks, and instead seeks to minimize the risk to an acceptable level.
                                                                                                                  * SFAIRP: The SFAIRP (So Far As Is Reasonably Practicable) framework is similar to the ALARP framework, but focuses on what is reasonably practicable to do, rather than what is reasonably achievable. This framework is often used in situations where there is a need to balance the costs and benefits of risk control measures and to make decisions based on what is reasonably practicable.
All three frameworks are used to assess risk and determine appropriate risk control measures, but they differ in their approach and focus. The Minimax framework focuses on minimizing the worst-case scenario, while the ALARP and SFAIRP frameworks focus on balancing the costs and benefits of risk control measures and determining what is reasonably practicable to do.
Mind Mapping
Mind mapping is a visual technique used to organize and generate ideas in a non-linear way. It is a tool that can be used to brainstorm ideas, plan projects, take notes, and solve problems.
The basic process of mind mapping involves starting with a central idea or topic and branching out into related subtopics or ideas. Each idea is represented by a word, phrase, or image, and is connected to other ideas through lines or branches. The mind map can be expanded and refined as more ideas are generated, and can be used to organize and prioritize information.
Mind mapping is often used as a creative problem-solving technique, as it allows individuals or teams to explore different possibilities and connections. It can also be used to help individuals remember and retain information, as the visual nature of the mind map makes it easier to recall ideas and concepts.
Mind mapping can be done using paper and pen, or using software tools that allow for the creation of digital mind maps. There are many different approaches to mind mapping, and the technique can be adapted to suit the needs and preferences of the individual or team using it.
Monte Carlo Simulation
Monte Carlo simulation is a computer-based statistical method used to model and analyze complex systems that involve uncertainty and randomness. The method is named after the famous Monte Carlo Casino in Monaco, as the simulation relies on random numbers generated by a computer to model the behavior of the system.
The Monte Carlo simulation involves running multiple simulations of a system using random inputs, or inputs that vary within a specified range. These simulations produce a range of possible outcomes, which are then used to calculate the probabilities of different outcomes and to estimate the expected value of the system under different conditions.
The Monte Carlo simulation is widely used in many fields, including finance, engineering, physics, and operations research. It is particularly useful in situations where the behavior of a system is too complex to be modeled using traditional analytical methods or where there is a high degree of uncertainty and risk.
Some common applications of Monte Carlo simulation include:
                                                                                                                  * Evaluating the performance of financial portfolios and investment strategies under different market conditions.
                                                                                                                  * Analyzing the reliability and safety of engineering systems, such as aircraft and nuclear power plants.
                                                                                                                  * Estimating the cost and duration of large-scale construction projects.
                                                                                                                  * Optimizing supply chain management and inventory control systems.
The Monte Carlo simulation is a powerful tool for modeling and analyzing complex systems and making informed decisions based on data-driven insights. However, it can be time-consuming to implement, especially for large-scale simulations.
Lean Process Improvement
Lean process improvement is a methodology for improving process efficiency by identifying and eliminating waste, reducing lead time, and improving quality. Lean is based on the principle of continuous improvement and emphasizes the importance of engaging all employees in the process of improvement.
The Lean process improvement methodology typically involves the following principles:
                                                                                                                  * Value: Focus on delivering value to the customer by understanding customer needs and requirements.
                                                                                                                  * Value stream: Identify and map the value stream, which is the sequence of steps required to deliver value to the customer.
                                                                                                                  * Flow: Streamline the value stream to eliminate waste and reduce lead time.
                                                                                                                  * Pull: Establish a pull system in which products or services are produced only when there is demand from the customer.
                                                                                                                  * Perfection: Continuously improve the process to achieve perfection.
Lean process improvement involves a number of tools and techniques for identifying and eliminating waste, such as value stream mapping, 5S, Kanban, and Kaizen events. These tools and techniques are used to identify and eliminate non-value-added activities, reduce lead time, and improve quality.
The benefits of Lean process improvement include increased efficiency, reduced lead time, improved quality, and reduced costs. Lean can also lead to increased employee engagement and satisfaction, as it empowers employees to take ownership of their work and contribute to the improvement of the process. Lean process improvement is widely used in manufacturing, but it can also be applied to service processes and administrative processes.
Literature review
A literature review is a comprehensive and systematic review of the existing literature, research, and scholarship on a specific topic or subject. It involves collecting and analyzing published sources, such as academic articles, books, reports, and other documents, to gain a deeper understanding of a particular area of research.
Businesses can use literature reviews to identify opportunities, obstacles, and obligations associated with their strategy and operations in the following ways:
                                                                                                                  * Identifying opportunities: Literature reviews can help businesses identify new trends, emerging markets, and potential areas for growth and development. By analyzing existing literature, businesses can identify gaps in the knowledge base and identify areas where further research or exploration may be warranted, which can lead to new opportunities.
                                                                                                                  * Identifying obstacles: Literature reviews can help businesses identify potential obstacles or challenges that may hinder their ability to achieve their goals. For example, it can highlight regulatory or legal barriers, technical limitations, or cultural or social factors that may limit the success of a particular initiative or project.
                                                                                                                  * Identifying obligations: Literature reviews can help businesses identify existing obligations, such as legal or ethical requirements, that must be taken into account when developing their strategy and operations. This can help ensure that businesses are operating in compliance with relevant laws and regulations and are meeting their obligations to stakeholders.
By conducting a literature review, businesses can gain a deeper understanding of the opportunities, obstacles, and obligations associated with their strategy and operations. This can help businesses make informed decisions, identify areas for improvement, and develop strategies to achieve their goals. A thorough literature review is essential for developing a comprehensive and informed approach to identifying and pursuing opportunities while also addressing potential obstacles and obligations.
Log Management
Log Management with automated alerts is a process of collecting, processing, and analyzing log data generated by different systems, applications, and devices in an organization. The log data contains information about events, activities, and errors that occur within the systems and applications, and can provide valuable insights into the performance and security of the organization's IT infrastructure.
Net Promoter Score (NPS)
Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a metric used to measure customer satisfaction and loyalty. It is based on the question: "On a scale of 0-10, how likely are you to recommend our product/service to a friend or colleague?" Customers who respond with a score of 9 or 10 are considered "promoters," those who respond with a score of 7 or 8 are considered "passives," and those who respond with a score of 0-6 are considered "detractors."
To calculate the Net Promoter Score, the percentage of detractors is subtracted from the percentage of promoters. The resulting score can range from -100 to 100, with higher scores indicating higher levels of customer loyalty and satisfaction.
The NPS is a popular metric used by businesses to gauge customer satisfaction and loyalty, and to identify areas for improvement. By tracking changes in the NPS over time, businesses can gain insights into customer needs and preferences and can make changes to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty. The NPS is a simple and effective way to measure customer satisfaction and has become a widely recognized benchmark for customer experience in many industries.
Network Analysis (Stakeholders)
In the context of stakeholder analysis, network analysis refers to the process of identifying and analyzing the relationships between different stakeholders and the extent of their influence and impact on a particular project or organization. It involves mapping out the stakeholder network to understand the connections, power dynamics, and communication channels between stakeholders.
The network analysis can be done using various techniques, such as social network analysis (SNA) and stakeholder mapping. SNA involves creating a visual representation of the stakeholder network, where stakeholders are represented as nodes or points, and the relationships between them are represented as lines or connections. SNA can help identify key stakeholders who may have significant influence over the project or organization and who may need to be engaged or managed more effectively.
Stakeholder mapping involves identifying stakeholders based on their level of interest and power and categorizing them into groups based on their level of support or opposition to the project or organization. The stakeholder map can be used to develop a stakeholder engagement plan, which outlines the strategies and tactics for engaging with different stakeholder groups to manage their expectations and concerns.
Overall, network analysis is a useful tool for stakeholder analysis, as it can help organizations better understand their stakeholder landscape and develop effective stakeholder engagement strategies.
Objectives and Key Results (OKR)
The OKR framework is a goal-setting methodology that stands for Objectives and Key Results. It was created by Andy Grove, the former CEO of Intel, and popularized by John Doerr, a venture capitalist who introduced it to companies like Google and LinkedIn.
The OKR framework is designed to help organizations set clear and measurable goals and track their progress towards achieving them. The basic idea is to set ambitious and specific objectives that are supported by concrete, measurable results, or key results. Key results should be both achievable and quantifiable, and they should be used to gauge progress towards the objective.
The OKR framework is typically used by teams, departments, or entire organizations to align their goals and ensure that everyone is working towards the same objectives. By setting clear goals and regularly tracking progress towards them, teams can stay focused, motivated, and aligned, and can adjust their strategies as needed to achieve success. 
Open Door Policy
Open Door Policy is a notification tool implemented by some organizations that allows employees at all levels to communicate directly with upper management, bypassing the traditional hierarchical channels of communication. The policy encourages employees to raise concerns, provide feedback, and make suggestions without fear of retaliation or retribution.
The Open Door Policy can take different forms, but it typically involves providing employees with access to higher-level managers, such as the CEO or the HR Director, through various means, such as regular meetings, email, phone calls, or a designated hotline. The policy often includes a commitment to respond promptly to employee concerns and to take appropriate action.
PESTLE Analysis (also PESTEL)
PESTEL analysis is a framework used to analyze and understand the external macro-environmental factors that can affect an industry or organization. The acronym PESTEL stands for six key factors:
                                                                                                                  * Political: This factor includes the political stability and policies of a country or region, as well as the potential for changes in government, regulations, or laws that can impact the industry or organization.
                                                                                                                  * Economic: This factor includes the economic conditions and trends, such as inflation, interest rates, and unemployment rates, that can impact the industry or organization.
                                                                                                                  * Social: This factor includes the social and cultural trends and values that can impact the industry or organization, such as demographics, lifestyles, and attitudes.
                                                                                                                  * Technological: This factor includes the technological innovations and advancements that can impact the industry or organization, such as new technologies, automation, and digital transformation.
                                                                                                                  * Environmental: This factor includes the environmental regulations, concerns, and trends that can impact the industry or organization, such as climate change, sustainability, and resource scarcity.
                                                                                                                  * Legal: This factor includes the laws, regulations, and policies that can impact the industry or organization, such as intellectual property rights, labor laws, and consumer protection laws.
By analyzing these six factors, organizations can gain a comprehensive understanding of the external environment and identify opportunities and threats that can impact their operations, strategies, and decision-making.
Porter’s (also Porter’s Five Forces Framework)
The Porter Model of Industry Attractiveness, also known as Porter's Five Forces Framework, is a tool developed by Harvard Business School professor Michael Porter to analyze the competitive environment of an industry. The GRC Capability Model examines five key forces that affect the attractiveness and profitability of an industry. The five forces are:
                                                                                                                  1. Threat of New Entrants: This force assesses how easy or difficult it is for new entrants to enter an industry. The more difficult it is for new competitors to enter, the more attractive the industry is in terms of profitability.
                                                                                                                  2. Bargaining Power of Suppliers: This force analyzes the power of suppliers to increase prices or reduce the quality of goods and services provided to an industry. The higher the bargaining power of suppliers, the less attractive the industry is in terms of profitability.
                                                                                                                  3. Bargaining Power of Buyers: This force assesses the power of buyers to negotiate lower prices or demand higher quality goods and services. The higher the bargaining power of buyers, the less attractive the industry is in terms of profitability.
                                                                                                                  4. Threat of Substitutes: This force analyzes the extent to which alternative products or services can replace the products or services offered by an industry. The higher the threat of substitutes, the less attractive the industry is in terms of profitability.
                                                                                                                  5. Competitive Rivalry: This force assesses the intensity of competition among existing firms in an industry. The higher the level of competition, the less attractive the industry is in terms of profitability.
The Porter Model of Industry Attractiveness helps organizations understand the competitive environment of an industry and identify key factors that influence its profitability. By analyzing these five forces, organizations can make informed decisions about strategic positioning, competitive advantage, and profitability.
Resource-Based View
Resource-Based View (RBV) is a management framework that focuses on the internal resources and capabilities of an organization as sources of competitive advantage. The RBV framework argues that it is the unique resources and capabilities that an organization possesses that enable it to achieve a sustained competitive advantage over time.
According to the RBV framework, an organization's resources and capabilities can be classified into two types: tangible and intangible. Tangible resources refer to physical assets, such as land, buildings, and equipment, while intangible resources refer to non-physical assets, such as knowledge, brand equity, and organizational culture.
                                                                                                                  * The RBV framework argues that it is the intangible resources and capabilities, such as a firm's organizational culture, human capital, and innovative capacity, that are more likely to provide sustained competitive advantage because they are difficult to imitate or replicate by competitors.
The RBV framework emphasizes that organizations should focus on developing and leveraging their unique resources and capabilities, rather than trying to compete on price or scale alone. This requires a deep understanding of the organization's strengths and weaknesses, and a strategic approach to resource allocation and development.
The RBV framework is a valuable tool for understanding how an organization's resources and capabilities can contribute to its competitive advantage and long-term success. By focusing on the development and leveraging of its unique resources and capabilities, an organization can create sustained competitive advantage and deliver superior value to its customers.
Schein Model of Organizational Culture
The Schein Model of Organizational Culture is a framework developed by Edgar Schein, a prominent organizational psychologist. The model identifies three levels of organizational culture:
                                                                                                                  1. Artifacts: The visible and tangible aspects of an organization's culture, such as dress codes, symbols, physical layout, and language.
                                                                                                                  2. Espoused values: The stated values, beliefs, and attitudes that an organization claims to hold, often found in mission statements or company values.
                                                                                                                  3. Basic underlying assumptions: The deep-seated, often unconscious, beliefs and assumptions that shape an organization's behavior and decision-making processes.
According to the Schein Model, the deepest level of culture - the basic underlying assumptions - are the most difficult to change, as they are often deeply embedded in an organization's history and collective experience. In order to change an organization's culture, leaders must understand and address the underlying assumptions that shape behavior.
The Schein Model is often used as a diagnostic tool to assess an organization's culture and identify areas for improvement. By understanding the various levels of culture and their interplay, leaders can develop strategies to align their values and behaviors with the organization's goals and mission. The model is particularly useful for organizations seeking to transform their culture, as it provides a roadmap for understanding and changing deeply ingrained assumptions and beliefs.
Scenario Planning
Scenario planning is a strategic planning method used by organizations to explore and prepare for multiple possible futures. It involves creating and analyzing different scenarios based on various factors that could impact the organization's environment, such as economic conditions, technological advancements, political changes, or social trends. Scenario planning helps organizations identify potential opportunities and challenges, improve decision-making, and enhance their ability to adapt and respond to change.
Scenario planning was initially developed by military strategists and planners during World War II to analyze different potential outcomes of warfare. However, it was popularized and refined in the corporate world by Royal Dutch Shell in the 1960s and 1970s. Pierre Wack, a French planner, is often credited as a key figure in the development of scenario planning at Shell. His work on scenario planning helped the company navigate the oil crises of the 1970s and has since been adopted by numerous organizations across various industries for strategic decision-making.
Sensemaking
Sensemaking is the process of making sense of complex or ambiguous information to understand and create meaning. It is the way in which individuals and organizations create coherence and meaning out of situations, events, or experiences that may be uncertain, confusing, or ambiguous.
Sensemaking involves a variety of cognitive processes, such as perception, interpretation, inference, and judgment, as individuals or groups try to make sense of the world around them. It often involves identifying patterns, establishing causal relationships, and creating mental models that help to explain and understand complex phenomena.
Sensemaking can be applied in a variety of contexts, including business, healthcare, education, and public policy. It is particularly relevant in situations where there is a high degree of uncertainty or complexity, where decisions need to be made quickly, or where multiple perspectives need to be integrated to arrive at a shared understanding.
Effective sensemaking can help individuals and organizations to navigate uncertainty and complexity, identify opportunities, and make better decisions. It can also enhance creativity, innovation, and learning, and foster collaboration and communication within groups and across organizations.
There are several tools and techniques that can be used to facilitate sensemaking, including:
                                                                                                                  * Mind mapping: A visual technique that helps to organize and connect ideas and information, and to identify patterns and relationships between them.
                                                                                                                  * SWOT analysis: A framework used to analyze an organization's internal strengths and weaknesses, as well as external opportunities and threats.
                                                                                                                  * Root cause analysis: A problem-solving method that helps to identify the underlying causes of a problem or issue.
                                                                                                                  * Scenario planning: A technique that helps to anticipate and prepare for multiple future scenarios by analyzing the potential impacts and implications of different events and trends.

Stakeholder Interest and Power Model
The Stakeholder Interest and Power Model is a tool used in project management and stakeholder analysis to help identify the key stakeholders in a project or organization, as well as their level of interest and power. The GRC Capability Model consists of a grid with four quadrants, which are defined based on the stakeholder's level of interest in the project or organization and their level of power or influence over it:  
                                                                                                                  * Low interest, low power: These stakeholders have little interest in the project or organization and little power to influence its outcome. They are typically not a high priority for engagement or communication.
                                                                                                                  * High interest, low power: These stakeholders have a high level of interest in the project or organization, but little power to influence its outcome. They may be important to engage and communicate with to build support and avoid negative feedback.
                                                                                                                  * Low interest, high power: These stakeholders have little interest in the project or organization, but a high level of power to influence its outcome. They may need to be managed carefully to ensure that they do not obstruct or impede progress.
                                                                                                                  * High interest, high power: These stakeholders have a high level of interest in the project or organization, and a high level of power to influence its outcome. They are typically the most important stakeholders to engage and communicate with, as their support can be critical to the success of the project or organization.
By using the Stakeholder Interest and Power Model, project managers can identify the key stakeholders in a project or organization, and develop appropriate strategies for engaging and communicating with them. This can help ensure that the project or organization is aligned with stakeholder needs and expectations, and that the project is successful in achieving its goals.

                                                                                                                  * Products and Services: The offerings your company provides to help customers complete their jobs.
                                                                                                                  * Pain Relievers: The ways your products or services alleviate specific customer pains or challenges.
                                                                                                                  * Gain Creators: The ways your products or services create value by providing benefits or satisfying customer desires.
By working with the Value Proposition Canvas, businesses can ensure that their products or services are closely aligned with their customers' needs, leading to more successful and sustainable solutions. It also helps in identifying gaps, refining the product-market fit, and optimizing marketing and sales strategies to better communicate the value proposition to the target audience.
Value at Risk (VaR)
Value at Risk (VaR) is a risk management tool used to estimate the potential losses that an investment portfolio or financial institution could suffer over a given time period, with a given level of confidence. VaR is a measure of the maximum amount of loss that could occur at a given probability level, such as 95% or 99%.
VaR is calculated based on the statistical analysis of historical market data, such as stock prices or interest rates, using a variety of mathematical models. The VaR calculation takes into account the volatility of the market, the correlation between different assets in the portfolio, and other factors that could affect the value of the portfolio.
VaR is typically used by financial institutions to assess and manage the risk of their investment portfolios, and to set appropriate risk limits and capital reserves. VaR can also be used by investors to assess the risk of their own portfolios and to make informed investment decisions.
One of the main advantages of VaR is that it provides a single number that can be used to communicate the potential risk of a portfolio or investment strategy. However, VaR has several limitations and criticisms. For example, VaR assumes that market risks are normally distributed, which may not always be the case. VaR also does not take into account the possibility of extreme events, such as market crashes, which could result in losses greater than the estimated VaR.
Despite these limitations, VaR remains a widely used tool in risk management and investment analysis, and is an important part of the toolkit used by financial institutions and investors to assess and manage risk.
Value Chain Analysis
Value Chain Analysis is a strategic management tool used to examine and evaluate the activities within an organization that contribute to creating value for customers. It was first introduced by Michael E. Porter in his 1985 book "Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance." The value chain analysis helps companies identify their strengths and weaknesses and optimize their internal processes to maximize value creation, improve efficiency, and achieve a competitive advantage.
The value chain is divided into primary and support activities. Primary activities are those directly involved in the production, marketing, and delivery of a product or service, while support activities provide the necessary foundation for primary activities to take place.
Primary activities include:
                                                                                                                  * Inbound logistics: Receiving, storing, and distributing raw materials and inputs.
                                                                                                                  * Operations: Transforming inputs into finished products or services.
                                                                                                                  * Outbound logistics: Storing, transporting, and distributing the finished products to customers.
                                                                                                                  * Marketing and sales: Promoting, selling, and distributing the products or services.
                                                                                                                  * Service: Providing support to customers after the product or service has been sold.
Support activities include:
                                                                                                                  * Procurement: Purchasing the necessary inputs, materials, and resources.
                                                                                                                  * Human resource management: Recruiting, hiring, training, and developing the workforce.
                                                                                                                  * Technological development: Research and development, innovation, and technological support for the primary activities.
                                                                                                                  * Infrastructure: General management, planning, finance, accounting, legal, and other functions that support the entire organization.
By analyzing these activities, companies can identify opportunities to improve their value chain, reduce costs, enhance differentiation, and create a sustainable competitive advantage in their industry.
Whistleblower Hotline / Helpline
Whistleblower hotlines or helplines are channels through which employees, customers, or other stakeholders can report unethical or illegal behavior or activities within an organization. These hotlines are typically managed by a third-party provider or by the organization's internal compliance team to ensure that reports are handled in a confidential and impartial manner.
Whistleblower hotlines or helplines can be accessed through various means, such as phone, email, or web-based platforms. They provide a safe and confidential way for individuals to report concerns about fraud, corruption, harassment, discrimination, or other unethical or illegal activities without fear of retaliation.
Some of the benefits of whistleblower hotlines or helplines include:
                                                                                                                  * Increased transparency: Whistleblower hotlines or helplines can help to uncover issues that may not have been otherwise reported, providing organizations with greater visibility into potential areas of risk.
                                                                                                                  * Improved compliance: By providing employees and stakeholders with a way to report unethical or illegal behavior, organizations can improve their compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.
                                                                                                                  * Enhanced reputation: By demonstrating a commitment to ethical conduct and transparency, organizations can enhance their reputation and brand value.
                                                                                                                  * Early detection: Whistleblower hotlines or helplines can help to detect potential issues early, allowing organizations to take corrective action before they escalate into more significant problems.
